0,"SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARY'S INFLATION FIGURE
  Sweden's rate of inflation during
  January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in
  calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
      The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of
  the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without
  explaining how the error arose.
      Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1
  pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation
  rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for
  January's revised figures, it added.
      Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against
  a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct
  in February 1986, the bureau said.
      The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government
  imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the
  bureau added.

2,"IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND
  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
  Energy Agency said.
      Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around
  one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,
  the IEA said in its latest monthly report.
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average
  consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for
  these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.
      The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar
  current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.
      If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of
  the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.
      IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD
  area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This
  is about the same as at the begining of the year.
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
  1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
  102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.
      The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
  continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line
  with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.
      Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
  at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
  and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down
  from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption.
      The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
  stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
  quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of
  400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in
  March.
      And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
  particulary for March, it said.
      As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also
  been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the
  IEA said.
      World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
  two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd
  in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally
  Planned Economies, the IEA said.
      Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first
  quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months
  of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as
  against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest
  factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.
  

",[86],['crude'],"The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a slower growth in oil demand within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, with a projected increase of around 1% in 2023 compared to 2.3% in 1986. This growth is expected to be primarily driven by transport fuels, but higher consumer prices may impact the rate of growth. The IEA also predicts that if crude and product prices remain stable, end-users may reduce their oil stocks, leading to a potential shift in market share from heavy fuel to natural gas. OECD oil stocks were estimated at 428 million tonnes in April 1987, remaining flat compared to the beginning of the year due to a projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter. Company and government oil stocks have increased, with company stocks rising in line with consumption after a five-year decline. World oil supply decreased in the first quarter of 1987, mainly due to a drop in OPEC crude production and seasonal factors in Centrally Planned Economies. The largest contributor to the OPEC production decline was a decrease in Saudi Arabian output."

4,"FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY
  French official reserves fell 45.06
  billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from
  421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry
  said in a statement.
      It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
  currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
  European Monetary System (EMS).
      Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs
  during the month, the ministry said.
      This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through
  operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,
  counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from
  the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
  with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
      But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc
  deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
  result of using very short-term financing instruments.
      The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
  other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange
  markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in
  an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight
  of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the
  franc.
      On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against
  the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.
      The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
  to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74
  billion at end December.
      Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.
      Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion
  francs from 75.27 billion at end December.
      Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln
  francs to 19.31 billion francs.
  

",[5],['reserves'],"French official reserves experienced a significant drop in January, decreasing by 45.06 billion francs, primarily due to foreign currency sales before the European Monetary System realignment. The decline was mainly attributed to a 33.90 billion franc deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, resulting from short-term financing instruments used by France. The Bank of France, along with other central banks, intervened in foreign exchange markets to support the franc and stabilize the mark, which led to a decrease in foreign currency reserves. This intervention culminated in the revaluation of the mark against the French franc on January 11th, easing pressure on the French currency. The reserves ended the month at 375.95 billion francs, with foreign exchange reserves at 98.83 billion francs and gold reserves unchanged at 218.45 billion francs."

  The European Commission has not taken a
  decision on applications from the British government for the
  release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the
  British market in May and June, Commission sources said.
      They said last week's cereals management committee agreed
  to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders
  between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to
  allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.
      However, it decided to leave consideration of the release
  of further wheat until later.
      The British government had applied for the release of a
  further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British
  intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.
      However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review
  the market situation nearer the time before giving its
  approval.
      The Commission was given new powers last year to control
  the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the
  sources noted.
      Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry
  of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that
  additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made
  available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged
  that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,
  depending on the state of the market.
      This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission
  had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the
  three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.
  

","[19, 39]","['wheat', 'grain']","The European Commission has not yet approved the UK government's request to release 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June, despite the UK's claim that the Commission had given an assurance for additional releases.

21,"ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS
  &lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a
  19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
  report improved results in future earnings periods.
      ""Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
  highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
  a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
  non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
  periods ahead,"" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
      The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
  ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
  ago.
      Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
  substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
  international operations remains weak, reflecting
  resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
  borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
  activities.
      The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
  mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
  earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
  from 42 mln dlrs last year.
      Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
  income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
  from international investment banking as well as a significant
  loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
      Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
  year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
  deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
  lower securities commissions from international investment bank
  operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
      The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
  98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
  consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.
  

",[41],['earn'],"Royal Bank of Canada reported a 19% drop in first-quarter earnings, but expects improved results in future periods.

26,"KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION
  Kenya's economy will continue to expand
  this year and the government will do more to encourage
  investment by foreign firms and the local private sector,
  Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.
      He told a news conference that the government would soon
  create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment
  applications by local and foreign investors.
      Praising the role of multinational companies and local
  entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to
  maintain a close working contact with the private sector.
      The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in
  1985, Ouko said.
      This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee
  exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,
  he added.
      ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,
  Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the
  planning minister said.
      ""High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade
  liberalisation and disciplined financial management are
  expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,"" he
  said.
      Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable
  weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises
  announced in February, the minister added.
      Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
  long rainy season, which is due to start about now.
      Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops
  increased during the second half of last year.
      Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya
  rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,
  he said.
      Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its
  contribution to the economy and promised to improve government
  cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact
  with them.
      ""I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its
  contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to
  maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector
  grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same
  period the previous year,"" he said.
      Ouko said the ""one stop"" bureau was intended to stimulate
  investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved
  in processing applications.
      The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan
  economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation
  falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.
      This was owing to higher agricultural production and the
  Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major
  currencies, the report said.
      The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr
  last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half
  yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in
  July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during
  the period.
      This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of
  780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,
  compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in
  the second half of 1985, it said.

"
30,"TALKING POINT/COPPER STOCKS
  Copper shares, which have lagged
  behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger
  demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.
      ""Copper prices should move up over the next four to six
  quarters,"" said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER>. ""I
  see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from
  around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world
  economic growth.""
      Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a
  pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.
      Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp &lt;PD> will be a strong
  performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.
      But Asarco Inc &lt;AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from
  copper, and Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> are also potential
  winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its
  copper operations to its shareholders.
      ""In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play
  and benefits most from higher copper prices,"" one said.
      William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,
  said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining
  operations. ""They've accomplished a great deal,"" he said.
      The company's move into carbon black, a product used in
  tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid
  growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.
  He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs
  in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.
      Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter
  Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.
      Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and
  four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this
  year and around 3.50 dlrs next year.
      ""The stock can go to the mid 30s,"" Roling said, from its
  current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40.
      ""Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need
  copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money,"" said
  Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. ""The shares will
  outperform the market over the next 18 months,"" he said.
      But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says
  Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. ""We'd rather
  place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a
  significant premium to the current stock price,"" he said.
      After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will
  have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co
  &lt;NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,
  Toufexis noted.
      Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in
  1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40
  dlrs from operations in 1986.
      ""I'd be buying up to 90,"" Toufexis said last week, when the
  stock rose sharply to near that level. ""But the shares are
  probably worth about 108 dlrs (each).""
      Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like
  Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison
  sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses
  in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and
  from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988.
      Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co
  &lt;CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in
  coal and other minerals aside from copper.
      But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced
  at current levels. ""I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy
  Phelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock,"" he said.
  

",[26],['copper'],"Copper shares are expected to perform well in the coming year due to increasing demand and rising metal prices. Analysts predict that copper prices will rise to 70 cents per pound in 1988, up from 63-64 cents, driven by tight supply and global economic growth. Phelps Dodge Corp, the largest US copper producer, is seen as a top performer, with analysts citing its cost-cutting measures and diversified operations. Other recommended stocks include Asarco Inc, which has reduced costs and restructured, and Cyprus Minerals Co, although some analysts believe it is currently overpriced. Newmont Mining Corp is also a popular pick, as it is spinning off 85% of its copper operations, which could lead to significant gains for investors. Overall, copper stocks are expected to outperform the market in the next 18 months, with potential share price increases of up to 40%."
31,"LIVE CATTLE RALLY AS LOCKOUT AT MEAT PLANT ENDS
  Live cattle futures posted a robust
  rally today after a major beef packing company said it would
  end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb.
      April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
  closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market
  expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant
  restarts operations.
      Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum,
  said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the
  nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14,
  the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the
  United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired.
      The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several
  thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said.
      The company said it locked out union workers because they
  threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union
  meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the company's
  latest contract offer March 5.
      Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors
  circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further
  fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on
  cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle.
      The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and
  frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications
  that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate
  than previously expected.
      Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York
  Mercantile Exchange.
      But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the
  price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday,
  said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith
  Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
      Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices
  recover from early weakness, traders said.
      Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the
  silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver
  prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its
  customers buy the metal, traders said.
      Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that
  Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said.
      Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar
  and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European
  Commission on Wednesday.
      Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the

      Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture
  Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation
  Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible
  land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said.
      Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt
  exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just
  beginning, also underpinned prices, they said.
      Wheat prices were pressured by selling in response to
  trends on price charts, they said.

The rally in cattle prices also positively influenced live hog and frozen pork belly values. Petroleum futures saw a modest increase, while gold futures rose in response to silver market strength. Coffee futures dipped due to Colombia's reduced export prices, and sugar prices closed slightly higher despite the European Commission's large export sale. Soybeans were up on expectations of a strong Conservation Reserve Program enrollment and concerns about potential export disruptions in Brazil.

35,"BRAZIL TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET
  Brazilian President Jose Sarney
  announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of
  U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at
  promoting imports of foreign goods.
      In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face
  ""current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the
  purchase of goods.""
      The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is
  technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in
  the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above
  the official rate.
      Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery
  and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the
  parallel market without having to wait for an official order
  from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).
      Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an
  effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate
  the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the
  economy.
      The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council
  (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's

  The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank
  said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's
  minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits
  from its operations in the country.
      Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply
  with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln
  dinars -- by the start of 1986.
      Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told
  Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher
  level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The
  bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.
      Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher
  capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided
  instead to close its operation, banking sources said.
      Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while
  the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.
      Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an
  exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.

40,"U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL
  A White House-ordered report said 
  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
  could have potentially damaging implications for national
  security.
      The Energy Department study discusses several options to
  curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
      President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
  out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
  the depressed domestic oil industry.
      Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
  ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
  years, this report shows that there is justification for
  national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
  domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""
      The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
  consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
      Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
  oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
      President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
  determination that the country never again become captive to a
  foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
  sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
      The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
  make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
  oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
  depress the nation's economy.

50,"TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS
  Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff
  cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,
  A senior economic planner said.
      Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
  planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further
  reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
  half of this year.
      Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
  Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
      ""We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
  faster and more substantially,"" he said.
      The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said
  the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
  almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as
  too selective.
       Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
  billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign
  exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made
  Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
      Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened
  Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,
  particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
  among the island's main export-earners.
      A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington
  tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year
  limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.
      Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was
  limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is
  losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given
  more generous terms.

",[33],['trade'],"Taiwan is planning to reduce import tariffs on 1700 products, with cuts of up to 50%, to address its trade surplus with the United States, which reached $13.6 billion in the previous year. This surplus has led to a foreign exchange reserve of $50 billion, making Taiwan a target for US protectionism. The trade surplus has also weakened Taiwan's position in export quota negotiations with the US for products like shoes, textiles, and machine tools. A Taiwanese trade delegation is heading to Washington to renegotiate an agreement that limits the growth of Taiwan's textile exports, as they feel they are losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong."

52,"EC AND COMECON ENDS TALKS WITH PROGRESS
  The European Community (EC) and
  Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here, having made progress on
  setting up formal trade relations, but no breakthrough because
  of Comecon's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the
  EC, delegates said.
      Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of
  a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30
  years of mutual non-recognition. John Maslen, head of the EC
  delegation, told Reuters as he emerged from the final session:
  ""We made some progress, but we have called for another meeting.""
      Officials, who asked not to be named, said the Comecon team
  had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which
  would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC.
      Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements
  signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause
  stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC. An EC
  negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said: ""We wanted
  the territorial clause in, but Comecon said no.""
      A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was
  made towards clarifying positions, but another meeting would be
  necessary to complete the work.
      Any decision in principle to set up relations would require
  approval by the Community's Council of Ministers and by the
  executive committee of Comecon.
      Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads the
  East bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: ""We
  have narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but not
  on all questions.""
      Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any
  joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the
  Community, he replied: ""This question is not contained in the
  draft which our side presented.""
      West German diplomats said they would insist on including
  the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.
      The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading
  blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks
  between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic
  relations in January.
      The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite
  non-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a five
  billion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about half
  the deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price of
  Soviet oil imported by the EC.
  

",[33],['trade'],"The European Community (EC) and Comecon, a Soviet-led economic organization, held talks to establish formal trade relations, but failed to reach an agreement due to Comecon's refusal to recognize West Berlin as part of the EC. The EC requires all its contracts to include a territorial clause acknowledging West Berlin as an integral part of the EC, which Comecon rejected. Despite this setback, progress was made in clarifying positions, and further meetings are planned to continue the negotiations. The EC currently trades with individual Comecon member states, and the talks aimed to establish official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition. West German diplomats emphasized the importance of including the clause on West Berlin in any agreement between the EC and Comecon."
53,"MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT
  Governments of major Asian
  producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new
  International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and
  traders are unhappy with the development, according to views
  polled by Reuter correspondents.
      Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which
  produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the
  new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber
  industries remain viable in the long-term.
      But traders and growers said they were against the new pact
  because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere
  with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.
      The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on
  October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's
  producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.
      It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in
  New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter
  into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting
  for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.
      Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said
  the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of
  liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber
  and a possible depression of prices.
      He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to
  keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose
  or fell through its buffer stock system.
      Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of
  purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a
  contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done
  through direct cash contributions from members, he said.
      Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to
  finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed
  with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become
  indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International
  Tin Agreement.
      ""This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out
  without any financial encumbrance,"" Lim said.
       Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking
  cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers
  and consumers would also become members, he said.
      Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit
  to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.
      It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because
  its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.
      Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new
  pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt
  the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market
  operations.
       Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free
  rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at
  levels that were only acceptable to consumers.
      ""With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable
  level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,
  while producers may never see sharp price rises,"" a Malaysian
  Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters.
      Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the
  overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had
  psychologically prevented price rises, he said.
      State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had
  been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a
  buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.
      Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was
  expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.
      Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be
  pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to
  stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers
  to produce more.
      Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's
  conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to
  allow sharp price fluctuations in future.
      ""The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be
  liquidated and a free market returned,"" a Malaysian trader said.
      Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success
  as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they
  questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers
  to finance buffer stock operations.
  

",[28],['rubber'],"The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) has received mixed reactions from Asian governments, growers, and traders. While governments in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand welcome the pact as a way to stabilize prices and support the rubber industry, growers and traders are concerned that the buffer stock mechanism will interfere with free market forces and prevent rubber prices from rising sharply. The new INRA, which replaces the current agreement expiring on October 22, aims to maintain price stability through its buffer stock system. Malaysian officials are optimistic about the new agreement and believe it will prevent a potential depression in prices, while Indonesian and Thai officials also see benefits in price stabilization and improved financial provisions. However, Malaysian growers and traders prefer a free market without the influence of a large INRA buffer stock, which they believe limits price increases. Traders in the region also worry that the new pact might pressure prices in the long term as increased production could result from the pact's price stabilization potential. Overall, the new INRA has generated differing opinions among Asian stakeholders, with some favoring its price stabilization measures and others expressing concerns about its impact on the free market and potential limitations on price increases."

59,"MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS
  Most Japanese companies have decided not
  to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
  prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
  industry sources said.
      They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
  traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
  official price of 17.42 dlrs.
      Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
  Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
      The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
  total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
  under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
  the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
      They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
  on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
  depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
      ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
  probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese
  refiner said.
      ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added.
      Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
  at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
  considerably lower, oil traders said.
      They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
  problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
  Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
  finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
  likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
      The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
  OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
  fixed prices.
      But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
  its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
  would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
      They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
  based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
  should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
  a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
      One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of
  pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
  there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
  ability.""
      Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
  told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all
  member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
  December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
  and official selling prices.""
      He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
  of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
  well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
  return to the market in search of crude.
      A Japanese refiner said, ""The European and U.S. Markets are
  beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.""
  

",[86],['crude'],"Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew their term contracts for Iranian crude oil due to the significant difference between spot prices and OPEC's official prices. Only one Japanese company has renewed its contract for the second quarter, with the majority opting to lift a reduced amount of Iranian crude. This decision could prompt Iran to offer discounts on April cargoes, but this depends on the spot price levels. Japanese refiners state that they would buy Iranian crude at the official price if the spot price of Dubai crude exceeds $17.30. OPEC's official price structure and production ceiling could balance supply and demand by the end of the second quarter, and limit spot price fluctuations. Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman affirmed that OPEC members are committed to the December agreement and will adhere to their quotas and official selling prices."

  Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed
  to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
  from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
  said.
      The current account balance of payments in February showed
  a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
  compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
      Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
  surplus, the same as in January.
      Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
  billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
  record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
      Trade Department officials said the improvement in
  Britain's current account contrasted with most private
  forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
  rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
  expected.
      The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January

66,"COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE
  The International Cocoa Organization
  (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the
  downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying
  operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.
      Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could
  reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices
  significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging
  the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the
  ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special
  Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 ""must buy"" level.
      Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last
  month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer
  stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.
      Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer
  stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used
  to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average
  above the 1,600 SDR ""must buy"" level.
      The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of
  the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New
  York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per
  tonne yesterday.
      Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and
  September, but these are set to change to July, September and
  December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot
  month, traders noted.
      The introduction of December into the calculations may lift
  the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75
  stg above May on the London terminal market.
      But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the
  higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the
  indicator which governs his activities, traders said.
      ""The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the
  implications of delaying until forward prices lift the
  indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,"" an
  analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.
      Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000
  tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach
  this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an
  ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market
  watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent
  forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln
  to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to
  three mln.
      A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87
  world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared
  with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of
  94,000 tonnes, traders said.
      In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to
  buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the
  ""must buy"" level.
      But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put
  constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock
  manager can remove cocoa from the market.
      The buffer stock system of price differentials set
  according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from
  non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,
  dealers said.
      Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is
  nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.
      But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as
  Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa
  can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer
  stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.
      Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member
  cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are
  pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.
      Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from
  quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact
  on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for
  this cocoa over futures.
      Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg
  from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer
  stock buying, dealers said.
      ""The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will
  provide a backstop for quality cocoas,"" one trader said.
      Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer
  stock were ""all prognostication"" and that no one could hope to
  predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically
  buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer
  stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the
  previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers
  expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.
      In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding
  scheme as an additional market support mechanism.
  

",[38],['cocoa'],"The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is preparing to implement a buffer stock system to stabilize cocoa prices, but traders and analysts are skeptical about its effectiveness. The buffer stock may face challenges due to the surplus of cocoa in the market, with initial purchases potentially reaching 75,000 tonnes without significantly impacting prices. The ICCO's indicator price is currently below the ""must buy"" level, and the buffer stock manager might delay purchases until forward prices lift the indicator. The system's rules, including price differentials and purchase limits, could restrict the buffer stock's ability to remove cocoa from the market effectively. Traders believe that the buffer stock may not help the terminal market but could provide support for quality cocoas. However, with the market already in surplus and the buffer stock carrying over 100,000 tonnes from the previous agreement, doubts remain about its ability to counter bearish pressure."

68,"MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY
  Malaysia's state oil company Petronas
  will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from
  May 1, trade sources said.
      Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
  September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest
  cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.
      Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
  10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.
      However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
  that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an
  average 510,000 bpd in 1987.
      The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
  at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit
  further production cutbacks, the sources said.
      Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl
  this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.
      Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to
  the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced
  Indonesian and Chinese crude output.
      The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as
  there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due
  to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.
      In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two
  to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month
  for sale through tender, the sources said.
      However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the
  reduced scale of production, they said.
  

",[86],['crude'],"Petronas, Malaysia's state oil company, is reducing oil production to 420,000 barrels per day from May 1, 1987, a 17.5% decrease from the 1986 target level. This additional cut follows a 10% reduction in September 1986 to support OPEC's price-boosting efforts. The decision to further reduce output was influenced by the rise in crude oil prices, with Malaysia's Tapis blend exceeding $18/barrel this year. The cutback aims to maintain prices and address concerns about buyers seeking cheaper alternatives. The reduction in production may lead to tighter availability of Asian oil grades and a decrease in Petronas' spot cargo sales."

  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer

  dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
  was no immediate need to change it.
      Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news

  quota.
      Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
  continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
  adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
      The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
  ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
  averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
      Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
  measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
  will take place as scheduled.""

  members were abiding by its agreements.
      ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
  were not at all verified,"" he said.
      OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
  13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
  18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
      Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
  have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
  traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
      Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
  4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
      ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
  devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
  the agreement,"" he said.
      Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
  Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
  storage, Nazer said.
      King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
  Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
  stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
  competition with OPEC.
      ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
  desires price stability,"" he said.
      Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
  returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
      Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
  bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
  over-production by some OPEC states.
      ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
  by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
  mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
  members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
      Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
  quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
      But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
  OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
  necessary measures.""
      Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
  demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
  hemisphere spring and summer.
      Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
  from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
  agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
  he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
      ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
  programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
  conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
  conditions,"" Nazer said.
      He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
  -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
  they saw fit.
  

",[86],['crude'],"Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian Oil Minister, believes that the December agreement between OPEC members to stabilize oil prices at $18 per barrel is being successfully implemented, and there is no immediate need to make changes. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is currently producing around 3 million barrels per day, below its OPEC quota, and will continue to do so as long as other members adhere to the agreement. The OPEC production cuts have led to a rise in world oil prices, and Saudi Arabia is committed to defending the $18 per barrel price. Nazer is satisfied with the cooperation from non-OPEC producers and believes that the current agreement is sufficient, with no need for new measures before the next scheduled meeting in June."

  Cuban president Fidel Castro told a

87,"U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK
  U.S. economic data this week could be
  the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
  out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
      Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail
  sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy
  gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be
  positive for the market, the analysts said.
      ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds
  right now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig
  Sloane.
      Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
  traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
  rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
  to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
  materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
  quickly covered short positions, they said.
      ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
  as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said.
      Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector
  of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
      Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
  below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
  she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up
  0.8 to 1.2 pct.
      Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
  both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
  added.
      Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able
  to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
  bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds
  closed at 100-4/32 today.
      Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
  federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
  Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
      ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
  market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
  market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said.
      In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
  which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil
  rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,""
  Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
  six pct level.""
      The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
  Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
  may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
      Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
  ease to 99-6/32 and find support.
      ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
  The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said.
  

","[12, 69, 32]","['ipi', 'retail', 'interest']","The U.S. economic data for February, particularly retail sales and industrial production, are expected to show healthy gains, and these figures will be crucial in determining the direction of U.S. interest rate futures. Analysts suggest that numbers within or slightly below expectations could be positive for the market, with the consensus estimate for non-auto retail sales at a 0.6-0.7% increase. A lower-than-expected retail sales figure could boost debt futures, while industrial production and producer price index are also expected to show increases. The current trading range for debt futures is influenced by the federal funds rate and crude oil prices, and a pullback in oil prices could lead to a breakout above the range. Analysts are cautious about the recent oil price surge, but some predict a potential top at $18.50 per barrel, with the June bond contract finding support around 99-6/32."

  Finance and economy ministers of the

      They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from
  Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
  Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank
  governors on a common currency exchange rate.
      The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which
  to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be
  forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in
  Saudi Arabia late this year.
      The six states have different currency systems. Saudi
  Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the
  International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the
  special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.
      Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while
  Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by
  itself.
      The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not
  been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be
  linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.
      Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of
  State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint
  economic agreements ""is increasingly linking the interests of
  GCC citizens together.""

103,"SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS
  Secretary of State George Shultz has
  decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
  Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
  subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
  Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
      ""Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
  last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
  basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
  they want to do,"" the official said.
      If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
  Soviet Union, he said, ""Shultz will not wage a vigorous
  campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
  he won't go to the President and voice his objections.""
      In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
  yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
  Growers, the State Department said, ""Secretary Shultz expressed
  his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
  competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
      The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
  determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
  extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
  Program.""
      Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
  Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
  Moscow, the State Department official said.
      ""Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
  subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
  firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.""
      USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
  USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
  wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
      The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
  that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
  U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
      The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
  State Department source said.
      ""What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
  lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,"" he said.
      The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
  U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
      Government and commodity sources also said there are
  elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
      ""Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
  foregone conclusion,"" the State Department official said.
  

","[19, 39]","['wheat', 'grain']","Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose a potential wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, leaving the decision to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department. Shultz fought against a similar subsidy last year but will not actively campaign against it this time. The State Department's official statement expresses Shultz's belief that US grain should be competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union. The Agriculture Department will determine if a subsidy should be extended under the Export Enhancement Program. However, there are still obstacles to the subsidy offer, as the Soviets previously rejected a similar offer due to insufficient subsidy. The Soviets are now seeking a higher subsidy, claiming they are the best customer of US grain and deserve the best price. There are also individuals within the USDA who oppose the subsidy."
104,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS
  Japanese microchip makers are being
  strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on
  semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's
  market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.
      But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring
  the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether
  the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
  breathing space, they said.
      U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
  have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
  chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.
      ""MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
  to get things done,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate
  vice president Peter Wolffe.
      Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
  January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
  chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
  to the pact's price controls.
      The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
  distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
  exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
  marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.
      U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
  jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets
  and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.
      But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
  production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp
  said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.
      ""NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's
  demands,"" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. ""Once
  NEC cuts production, it means they all have.""
      Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese
  firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that
  the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.
      ""The best way to lower cost is to produce more,"" said Salomon
  Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.
      Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
  spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
  Aizawa said.
      Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
  restrictions, some industry officials said.
      ""It's like tax avoidance schemes,"" said Steve Donovan, head
  of MMI Japan K.K. ""As soon as you close one route, another
  opens.""
      MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier
  shrugged off MITI guidance.
      ""It's getting to be like communism,"" said one.
      But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
  easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
  firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.
      ""They're going to have to start running their businesses
  like businesses,"" Bache's Wolffe said.
      MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
  urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry
  officials said response has been mixed at best.
      ""There has been some change, but it's not across the board,""
  said one U.S. Spokesman. ""The companies have a varying degree of
  urgency.""
      The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
  troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.
      Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic
  random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition
  to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.
      Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
  chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they
  said.
      Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.
  Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
  most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.
      Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.
  Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.
      ""The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't
  even have an office here,"" a source close to the industry said.
  ""You could question just how committed they are.""
      In addition, some industry analysts question the
  effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
  country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.
      ""(South) Korea's gaining market share,"" said one analyst.
  ""They're the real winners from the agreement.""
  

",[33],['trade'],"Japanese microchip makers are being pressured by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to comply with a U.S.-Japan agreement on semiconductors, which aims to end predatory pricing and open Japan's market to foreign chips. MITI is urging chipmakers to cut production and raise prices, and is encouraging chip users to buy foreign-made chips. However, some Japanese firms are resisting these efforts, and there are doubts about the success of the agreement due to market forces and the U.S. industry's readiness to take advantage of the situation. The impact on the U.S. industry is uncertain, and some analysts question the effectiveness of the bilateral agreement, as it excludes third-country chipmakers like South Korea, who are gaining market share. The fate of a new U.S. consortium aiming to challenge Japan's microchip manufacturing technology is also being closely watched."

  Yeutter said the stock market overreacted to a U.S. decision
  last week to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese computer
  products.
      Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House
  Agriculture Committee hearing, Yeutter said it is ""difficult to
  comprehend"" that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs
  in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday.
      ""I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that
  (stock market fall), including simple profit-taking,"" Yeutter
  said.
      Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from
  its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the
  computer chip dispute.
      ""We will be glad to have him here, but that's not going to
  affect a decision that's already been made,"" Yeutter said.
      The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs
  on a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the alleged
  failure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the U.S. on
  semiconductor trade.

  Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a
  new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared
  with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
  earlier, the central bank said.
      Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
  came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
  U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
  March 4.
      He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
  Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
  surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
      Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
  but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
  U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
      In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
  on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
  Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
  with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
  billion, according to official statistics.
      Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
  Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
  planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
  of this year.
      The reserves could support imports of more than two years

136,"THAI TRADERS OPPOSE REIMPOSITION OF COFFEE QUOTAS
  Thai coffee exporters said they hoped
  the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose
  export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in
  world prices.
      Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee
  Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained
  little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only
  about 30 pct of its total annual exports.
      Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
  there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
  offer higher prices than non-members, he said.
      The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes
  of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.
      Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000
  tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the
  previous year.
      However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai
  government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed
  ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.
      Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial
  Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would
  encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,
  further depressing prices.
      He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial
  amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.

141,"GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING
  The Association of German Cooperative
  Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates
  would continue to remain low for the time being.
      It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong
  foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in
  the economy that could affect the long-term capital market.
      The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for
  higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation
  late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in
  nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.
      The association said generally low interest rates,
  prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected
  strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment
  climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue
  its slow but very sure growth.
      The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest
  rates down on the short-term money market although its policies
  had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,
  which was so important for investment financing and thus for
  the course of the economy, it said.
      In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy
  had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the
  association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy
  through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.
      On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking
  dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.
      The association said time would show to what extent
  speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic
  money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank
  could hold down money market rates with the highly effective
  instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.
  

",[32],['interest'],"The Association of German Cooperative Banks predicts that domestic interest rates will remain low in the near future, with the Bundesbank able to manage and control these rates despite external influences. They believe the economy will continue its steady growth due to low interest rates, potential tax reductions, a stable dollar, and strong domestic demand. The association also mentions that while the Bundesbank has successfully controlled short-term money market rates, it has less influence on the long-term capital market, which is crucial for investment financing. They argue against using short-term expansionist monetary policies to stimulate the economy and suggest that the money supply target for 1987 may not be necessary."

143,"JAPAN/U.S. WILL BE AT ODDS WHILE TRADE LOPSIDED
  Japan is doing all it can to solve its
  trade problems with the United States but the two nations will
  remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in
  Japan's favour, a senior official said.
      ""So long as there is an external imbalance there will be
  trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,""
  the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
      Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with
  the United States and economists said they do not see it
  falling significantly any time soon.
      Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln
  dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the
  spectre of a trade war between the two countries.
      ""We take the current situation very seriously,"" said the
  official, who declined to be identified. ""The basic stance of
  the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all
  available resources.""
      The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an
  agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer
  microchips in world markets and to try to import more American
  semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.
      The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese
  retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs
  in the middle of this month. But he said that any response
  would be in accordance with international law and Japan's
  international obligations.
      He added that both Japan and the United States must take
  account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the
  world economy.
  

",[33],['trade'],"Japan and the United States are experiencing trade friction due to a large trade surplus in Japan's favor, causing tension between the two countries. The US plans to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics, potentially leading to a trade war. Japan denies accusations of unfair trade practices regarding computer microchips and is prepared to respond within international law if the US proceeds with tariffs. The trade imbalance will likely persist, causing ongoing trade disputes between the two nations."

162,"KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS
  The Fried. Krupp GmbH
  &lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
  1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
  18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
      Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
  billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
  16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
      Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
  weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
  falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
      The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
  plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
      Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
  business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
  underpinned machinery and component activities.
      An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
  trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
  figures.
      However, ""all business sectors contributed to the positive
  results achieved in 1986,"" Krupp added, without giving details.
      Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
  from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
  billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
  orders against 40 pct in 1985.
      Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
  member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
  rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
      The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
  end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
      Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
  three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
      The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
  mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
  foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
  industries.
      The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
  steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
  But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless
  cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.
  

",[41],['earn'],"Krupp, a German steel and engineering company, reported a 12% decrease in total sales for 1986 compared to the previous year, mainly due to the dollar's weakness against the mark and falling oil and raw material prices. Despite this, the company considered the year satisfactory due to the growth in the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42% of total sales. The mechanical engineering business and acquisitions also contributed to positive results. However, the steel sector faced challenges with a 3% decline in orders, mainly due to exchange rate movements and a weak market for sections and flats of quality steel. Special steel saw growth due to increased demand for stainless cold-rolled flats."

172,"MORE U.S. GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED, STUDY SAYS
  More generic grain certificates
  should be released onto the market in order for the U.S.
  certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,
  according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.
      The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency
  payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third
  certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, 
  Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a
  House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.
      Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly
  a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.
      The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible
  scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a ""zero
  certificate case,"" where no certificate program was assumed,
  and an alternative case labeled ""adequate certificate case"" in
  which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain
  prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages
  due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.
      The study showed that total grain use under the adequate
  certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario
  by 11.2 pct.
      Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain
  usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the
  zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.
      For the five-year period examined, government expenditures
  under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or
  7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.
      The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of
  those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.
      The study also estimated that government grain stocks under
  the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels
  below the zero certificate case at the end of the period
  examined.
      The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market
  prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase
  commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus
  cash.
  

",[39],['grain'],"The Sparks Commodities Inc. study suggests that releasing more generic grain certificates into the market will increase grain usage and reduce government costs. The study compared two scenarios: one without certificates and another with sufficient certificates to prevent artificial grain price support. The ""adequate certificate case"" showed a 11.2% increase in total grain use, with notable increases in 1989 and 1990. This scenario also resulted in $7.0 billion in government savings over five years, primarily due to reduced storage costs. The study recommends a specific ratio of certificates to cash for government payments, emphasizing the benefits of certificates in lowering net costs."

180,"COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL
  Coffee producing countries must quickly
  map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on
  export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private
  coffee exporters' association, said.
      Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now
  would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including
  Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.
      An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with
  exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a
  resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after
  prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.
      Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but
  predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly
  plummet.
      However, he said the market should also take into account
  evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the
  near totality of the Central American crop.
      Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at
  1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past
  10 years.
      Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand
  the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations
  as well as for industrialized countries.
      It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to
  solve the problem of the developing world's external debt,
  decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying
  those debts, he said.
      ""In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,
  while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries
  which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,""
  Cardenas said.
  

",[35],['coffee'],"The failure of the ICO to reach an agreement on export quotas has prompted Colombia's coffee exporters' association president, Gilberto Arango, to call for a new common strategy among coffee-producing countries. Arango suggests that producers, including Brazil, should unite to defend prices. The recent ICO meeting in London ended without an agreement between exporting and consuming nations, which is expected to lead to a price drop in the short term. Colombia's coffee is currently quoted at its second-lowest price in a decade, and Arango emphasizes the impact of this failure on coffee-producing nations' economies and their ability to repay external debts. He also highlights the irony of countries cutting Colombia's coffee earnings while supporting its fight against drug trafficking."

189,"CHRYSLER &lt;C> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION
  Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of
  American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,
  including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
  American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.
      They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782
  mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.
      The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
  Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's
  agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln
  dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not
  included valuing the transaction.
      Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed
  purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the
  transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in
  Chrysler's earnings.
      A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told
  Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
  would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
  impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to
  assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards
  accumulated from its losses since 1980.
      ""There were very serious discussions last fall but we
  didn't pull it off,"" the source said in a reference to the
  assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
  Besse.
      ""It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.
  And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done
  it before the end of last year.""
      In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the
  source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
  lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called ""an overhang
  to the company.""
      Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
  the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
  in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln
  dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25
  mln dlrs in cash for ""transaction fees"" in connection with the
  acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid
  AMC shareholders.
      ""The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,""
  analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.
       Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
  billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.
       But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's
  liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
  debt that is being carried at ""non-market"" rates.
      He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
  previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
  were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an
  integral part.
      ""The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't
  their baby,"" he said.

The purchase price is smaller than it could have been due to the impact of the new US tax law, which removes Chrysler's ability to utilize AMC's tax-loss carryforwards. Chrysler will also assume any liability from Jeep safety lawsuits, and analysts expect short-term earnings dilution from the transaction. Moody's may downgrade Chrysler's debt due to the deal, but Chrysler plans to refinance AMC's debt at lower rates.

197,"GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD RISING IN 2ND HALF 1987
  The price of gold bullion is likely
  to rise in the second half of the year on increased private
  investor demand, West German analysts said.
      Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this
  year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank
  Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the
  U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.
      ""A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock
  exchanges,"" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for
  further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.
      Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.
      Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many
  investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.
      Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock
  exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.
      Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's
  foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is
  poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half
  of this year.
      The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an
  ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and
  430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

206,"ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN
  The International Cocoa Organization,
  ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft
  proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.
      The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
  Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European
  Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock
  should operate, they said.
      The proposal involved three key principles. First, the
  buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather
  than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.
      Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be
  free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.
      The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could
  comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third
  laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager
  would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be
  set by a formula, the delegates said.
      After the plan was presented, working group delegates met
  briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all
  consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction
  to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group
  meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.
      Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to
  work from, one consumer delegate said.
      Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for

219,"SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG>
  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
  action against Allegheny International Inc, the
  Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
      Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
  SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
  through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
      ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
  was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
  intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
  proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said.
      ""The company is cooperating in the commission's
  investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
  of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said.
      In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
  for information about company executive compensation and
  benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
  entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
      It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
  divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other
  internal controls,"" Allegheny said.
     The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
      The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
  on its enforcement actions.
      The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
  became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
  that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
  failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
  statements.
      The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
  complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
  securities law violations involving numerous current and former
  Allegheny officers and directors.
      Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
  court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
  the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
  public shareholders at an unfair price.
      Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
  against all charges.
      The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
  believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
  and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
      In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
  13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

221,"AUSTRALIAN OFFER FOR SAN MIGUEL SHARES
  Diversified investment company, &lt;Ariadne
  Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares
  in the Philippine brewing firm &lt;San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper
  reported.
      The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to
  President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander
  Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct
  of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the
  government.
      The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in
  Manila were not available for comment on the report.
      The shares are the entire block seized by the government
  from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that
  the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of
  San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president
  Ferdinand Marcos.
      The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14
  mln class B shares.
      Government officials have said earlier that the more
  valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.
      The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at
  which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might
  buy eight mln class A shares last week.
      ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the
  Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo
  Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.
      ""Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his
  corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so
  that the company's assets can be fully utilised.""
      San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of
  the major manufacturers of grocery lines.
      Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap
  food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the
  U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd>,
  a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.
      Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnover
  of about two billion, has interests also in mining, real estate
  and agricultural products.

232,"USX &lt;X> CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR LOWER DOLLAR
  USX Corp chairman David Roderick called
  for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies
  to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which
  last year reached 170 billion dlrs.
      In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club
  of Detroit, Roderick said, ""There should be total resolve that
  the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the
  currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus
  with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our
  trade deficit starts on the road to recovery.""
      Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the
  ""economic pain"" our trading partners experience as a result of
  a falling dollar.
      But, he added, ""As painful as the correction may be to our
  trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem
  uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,
  lengthy and steep world recession.""
      Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the
  dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major
  industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader
  group of currencies of nearly all developing nations.
      At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in
  the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240
  billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a
  surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the
  data were provided by economic consultants to USX.
      The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct
  rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other
  factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,
  ""to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental
  deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product
  quality.""
      These areas need to be improved but they are not the root
  cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged
  American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can
  compete in global markets.
      In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in
  securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate
  raiders and speculators.
      Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate
  Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement
  that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock
  they acquire in a company.
      Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all
  cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be
  required to have financing in place before a tender is made.
      Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash
  tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's
  stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential
  price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should
  be prohibited under the revised laws.
      Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but
  that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets
  or discourage ""fair price to all"" takeovers.
  

","[3, 33, 83, 51]","['acq', 'trade', 'dlr', 'money-fx']","USX Corporation's chairman, David Roderick, has advocated for a lower US dollar value against other currencies to address the significant trade deficit of $170 billion recorded in the previous year. Roderick believes that a declining dollar will facilitate a correction in the trade deficit and suggests that the dollar's rise between 1980 and 1985 was a primary contributor to the trade imbalance. He also emphasizes the need for American manufacturers to enhance their competitiveness in global markets. Additionally, Roderick proposes amendments to securities laws to prevent corporate raider and speculator abuses, including stricter regulations on tender offers and the prohibition of greenmail. These changes, he argues, will help curb abuses without harming financial markets or discouraging fair-priced takeovers."

235,"SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC
  Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
  its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of
  the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
  barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources
  said.
      They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
  averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the
  neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average
  of 3.5 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
  oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
  counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's
  quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
      The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
  world""s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
  official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
  sources said.
      King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
  Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
  commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an
  average 18 dlrs.
      ""Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions,"" he
  said.
      The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports
  averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
  down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
      They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
  with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
  artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
      The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
  past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,
  Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the
  timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
  official prices, the sources said.
      Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
  still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
  liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
      They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
  end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
  obligations.
  

",[86],['crude'],"Saudi Arabia's oil output has decreased to its lowest level in over a year, indicating their commitment to maintaining OPEC's agreed-upon oil prices of $18 per barrel. In the first eight days of March, Saudi output averaged 2.6 million barrels per day, down from 3.5 million in February. The kingdom is also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers, which contributes to its production quota of 4.133 million bpd. Saudi Arabia's exports from Gulf ports have decreased as well, and they are not attempting to store excess oil. The reduction in output is a strategic move to support higher oil prices, as reaffirmed by King Fahd."

241,"KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS
  Eastman Kodak Co said it will

  operations of its Eastman Chemicals division.
      A company spokesman said the company will take ""some
  writeoff"" in connection with the action in the first quarter
  and there will probably be a further ""carryover"" writeoff in
  the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of
  plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected
  with the staff cuts.
      Kodak said the division will discontinue production of
  polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its
  Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100
  mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,
  mostly in Columbia.
      The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in
  Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,
  and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in
  Kingsport, Tenn.
      Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved
  through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan
  for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products
  Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense
  Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be
  completed by April 30.
      Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance
  have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY
  production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the
  business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman
  since last year.
      The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel
  polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from
  500 mln due to lesser demand.
      It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase
  in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.
      Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport
  units affected about 10,800.
      The company spokesman later said the charges will be
  insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

  price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
  is fully valued.
      Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
  another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
  for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
      Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
  had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
  Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
  might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
      analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
  offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
  sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
      Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
  Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
      Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
  shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
  29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
  a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
  courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
  dlrs per share.
      Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
  might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
  pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not
  reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
  on the transaction to be made public later this week.
  

",[3],['acq'],"Analysts believe that the 265 million dollar bid for Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management group is a fair offer and unlikely to be surpassed by another bidder. The 35 dollars per share price is considered fully valued, and the fact that Purolator has been on the market for some time without attracting other offers further supports this view. The stock price slightly declined today, indicating a lack of confidence in a higher bid. The deal includes a breakup fee that Purolator would have to pay if they back out, which could also deter potential rival bidders."

260,"BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES
  The Emirates Industrial Bank has
  predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
  following higher oil revenues.
      A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said
  total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
  countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
  33.5 billion in 1986.
      The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
  and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
      The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
  prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain
  overall group production.
      These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
  dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.
      ""All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
  the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected
  growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,""
  the study said.
      It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher
  budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
  recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.
      The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
  to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.
      It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined
  trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in
  1985.
      The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product
  to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it
  added.
  

",[86],['crude'],"The Emirates Industrial Bank forecasts a moderate economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states due to increased oil revenues. The study, carried by WAM, estimates that the six GCC countries' total oil revenues will rise to $39 billion this year, up from $33.5 billion in 1986. The bank attributes this improvement to higher oil prices resulting from OPEC's agreement to limit production. Despite the positive outlook, the study warns of higher budget deficits in GCC states due to past recession needs and the challenge of reducing spending. The combined GCC budget deficits are predicted to increase to $23.2 billion from $17.9 billion in 1986, with a decline in oil exports impacting the trade surplus. The UAE experienced a significant drop in GDP in 1986, falling to 77.6 billion dirhams from 96.4 billion in the previous year."
261,"CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD
  World Bank President Barber Conable
  expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
  new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
  throughout the industrial world.
      But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
  by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
  goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
  full-scale trade war.
      Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
  countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
  environment increased the possibility of global economic
  growth.
      ""We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
  countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
  opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
  developed world doesn't close at the same time,"" he said.
      He said the U.S. action against Japan was ""a significant
  retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
  trade policy.""
      The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
  meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
      Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
  Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
  and must be closely watched.
      He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
  making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
  developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
  increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
      The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
  debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
  funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
  aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
  and reducing government's role in the economy.
      ""We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
  however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,""
  Conable said.
      He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
  continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
  for some time.
      He noted, ""the problem of debt was a severe one and many
  countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
  problem of debt.""
      Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
  chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
  is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
  the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
  1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
  the World Bank.
      Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
  study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
  several weeks.
      He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
  part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
  poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
  richest countries because of inefficiency.
      the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
  Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
  member-countries as an indication of his management style and
  priorities.
      ""I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
  must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
  permitted to grow,"" Conable said.
      However, he said ""I don't believe there is anything
  basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
  has to have any redefinition of its purpose.""
      He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
  initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
  in dealing with the debt crisis.
      Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
  sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
  that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
  Camdessus on a variety of issues.
      On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
  to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that ""I don't have
  a particular mission here except to be useful to the
  institution and to the process of development.""
      He added, ""so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
  the institution.""
      On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
  that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
  the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
  of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
  Association was earmarked for Africa.
      Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
  forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
  in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.
  

",[33],['trade'],"Barber Conable, the president of the World Bank, is worried that trade protectionism, which is currently an issue between the US and Japan, could spread to other industrial nations. Conable believes that the US tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods do not indicate an impending trade war, but rather a significant retaliatory action. The World Bank has been encouraging developing countries to open their markets for increased global economic growth, and Conable wants to ensure that developed countries do not close their markets. He also expressed concern about the global debt situation, particularly in Brazil, and stated that the Bank will focus more on economic reform assistance. Conable, a former Republican Congressman chosen by President Reagan, is an associate of Treasury Secretary James Baker, who proposed a strategy for helping indebted nations. Conable is also working on a major study to reorganize the Bank to improve its efficiency and better serve both the poorest and richest countries. He believes the Bank's purpose does not need to be redefined, but its role in dealing with the debt crisis is central. Conable also discussed the Bank's focus on sub-Saharan Africa and the need for new forms of debt relief for the poorest nations."

264,"BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY
  Bundesbank council member Lothar
  Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy
  and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean
  pushing up interest rates.
      Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung
  financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account
  exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be
  confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.
      The article followed international press speculation that
  the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour
  of an exchange rate policy.
      Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position
  as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria,
  noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading
  interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led
  some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.
      ""Simply to ignore the external economic context would be
  risky and dangerous for monetary policy,"" he explained.
      Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an
  end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now
  assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency
  inflows slow down.
      Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and
  long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged
  investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller
  said.
      The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary
  growth back onto the desired path, he said.
      ""Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this
  quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the
  changed economic situation of the last few months,"" he added.
      ""All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money
  supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite
  suppositions to the contrary,"" Mueller said.
      ""Keeping money supply developments in check is not always
  synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when
  excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than
  growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary
  holdings of non-banks,"" Mueller said.
      Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits
  other concepts were needed for monetary policy.
      Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for
  monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.
      In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.
  Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.
      But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of
  a strict stability policy because both interest rates and
  liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention
  and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.
      Even interest rates are not in the centre of the
  Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other
  market conditions, Mueller said.
      A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central
  bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.
      This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity
  of industry and households which cannot be directly reached
  with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.
      The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the
  harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been
  the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable
  sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.
      ""If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise
  with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if
  credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed
  its target but probably even set off further inflows,"" he said.
      Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.
      In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate
  of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.
      The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to
  six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock
  growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.
      But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there
  should be no change in priorities. ""Monetary policy must be
  first and foremost stability policy and successful stability
  policy is money supply policy -- nothing else,"" he said.
  

","[51, 7]","['money-fx', 'money-supply']","The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, has not abandoned its money supply policy, according to Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller. Mueller clarifies that managing money supply growth does not always require raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity is due to foreign inflows rather than bank credit growth. He explains that the bank's recent interest rate cuts were in response to external economic factors and aimed to curb upward pressure on the German mark. Mueller emphasizes that the Bundesbank's primary focus is on stability, and successful stability policy is achieved through money supply management. The bank aims to keep money supply growth within a target range, with the current goal being 3-6% for central bank money stock growth."

268,"U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH
  U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
  figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation
  Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral
  to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown
  would be needed to assess the full price impact.
      ""Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in
  corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the
  trade was looking for,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham
  Lambert said.
      The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into
  the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837
  acres.
      Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of
  planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but
  some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates
  slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions
  figures March 31.
      Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program
  recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage
  to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.
      Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,
  said there was not enough information to completely assess the
  conservation figures. ""The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly
  disappointing,"" he added.
      The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the
  enrollment figures.
      Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for
  both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an
  upward adjustment in planting intention figures.
      Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates
  onto the market this spring, he said: ""The trade was definitely
  looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than
  expected.""
      The USDA offered a special corn ""bonus"" rental payment to
  the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus
  amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program
  payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the
  reserve.
      Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said
  the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had
  expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were
  considerably higher than the actual figures.
      ""I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the
  long run,"" she said.
      Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some
  confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure
  between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or
  the latest addition.
      ""It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid
  into the program,"" she said.
      Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas
  about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation
  sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as
  61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the
  high 60's.
      Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight
  reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to
  around 64 mln acres.
      New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed
  earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,
  despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor
  yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to
  final production figures.
  

","[64, 39]","['corn', 'grain']","The USDA released figures for highly-erodible land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program, which were viewed as neutral to bearish by grain analysts. The sign-up was slightly higher than expected, but some trade expectations were much higher. The initial figures were seen as negative for new crop corn and soybeans, and could lead to an upward adjustment in planting intention figures. The conservation sign-up had earlier led to a reduction in corn planting estimates, but analysts are now re-evaluating their estimates based on the latest figures. The impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring is also being considered, as the trade was expecting more certificates than will be available."

273,"HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
  The price of Hongkong and Shanghai
  Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
  takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
  and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock
  brokers said.
      They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
  announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
  Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
  Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
  billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
      Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
  on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
  But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
  from Liang as long term investment.
      He said Evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of
  Hk Hotels.""
      Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
  redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
  hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
  Hk Hotels.
      &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
  pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
      Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
  on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
      ""It is purely coincidence,"" he said.
      But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
  group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
  up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
      Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
  analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
  Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
      Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
  the Hk Hotels board.
      A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
  not considered any countermoves so far.
      Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
  Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
  styles.
      ""Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
  property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
  fit the conservative Kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked
  not to be named.
      Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
  distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
  only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
  Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
  current trading price.
      Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
  China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
  Ltd>.
      Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
  China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74
  cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.

Analysts speculate that Evergo, known for corporate raiding, may be interested in redeveloping the Peninsula Hotel and another site owned by Hk Hotels. Evergo's executive director, Thomas Lau, declined to comment on further acquisitions but confirmed the 20% stake as a long-term investment. Analysts suggest a potential partnership between Evergo and Lai Sun for a takeover, but different management styles may hinder cooperation with the conservative Kadoorie family. The current trading price of Hk Hotels is higher than the offers made by Evergo and Lai Sun, indicating a distortion in the market due to the takeover talks."

287,"ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD
  The Japanese economy will remain sluggish
  in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for
  12 years in 1986, private economists said.
      Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,
  was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and
  business investment would help sustain the economy this year,
  the economists said.
      They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency
  report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec
  quarter for the first time in 12 years.
      The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real
  0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the
  previous quarter.
      It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from
  4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst
  performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake
  of the first oil crisis.
      They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in
  consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was
  only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had
  depressed retail sales.
      But most private economists disagreed and said consumers
  were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw
  their real income level off.
      ""Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or
  heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but
  they have done so because they have become even more uneasy
  about their future pay rises,"" said Shoji Saito, general manager
  of Mitsui Bank's economic research division.
      He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of
   falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit
  hard by the yen's rise.
      Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said
  weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.
  Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve
  domestically generated economic growth as the government has
  put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.
      Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in
  Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including
  exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen
  Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,
  said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec
  resulted from an issue of gold coins.
      ""This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that
  high level of public-sector consumption in the following
  quarter,"" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending
  would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which
  marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.
      Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current
  quarter given the lack of additional significant government
  spending and sluggish consumer spending.
      Saito said the most effective government action would be
  income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a
  proposed controversial sales tax.
  

",[34],['gnp'],"Japan's economy is expected to remain sluggish in the upcoming months after a poor performance in 1986, according to private economists. Consumer spending, a key driver of domestic demand, is likely to remain low despite strong housing and business investment. The Economic Planning Agency reported a 0.7% decline in private spending in the fourth quarter of 1986, the first decrease in 12 years, which shocked economists. Japan's gross national product rose 0.8% in the same quarter, but GNP growth for 1986 was down from the previous year. Economists attribute the decline in consumer spending to both warm winter weather and consumer pessimism about future income and pay rises. The outlook for pay increases is gloomy due to job losses in industries affected by the rising yen. Some economists believe that the 0.8% growth in the fourth quarter may have been inflated by special factors, including heavy public sector spending on gold coins for Emperor Hirohito's 60th anniversary. The economy is expected to contract in the current quarter due to a lack of significant government spending and weak consumer spending."

  ChemLawn Corp said its board
  rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer
  and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.
      ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial
  advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
  purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
      ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
  ""poison pill,"" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
  adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
  means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
  purchasers.
      ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
  Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
  other relief.
      The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
  Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
  before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
  possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
  Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
      Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
  ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
      ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
  was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
  and could ""adversely affect"" the interests of its employees,
  suppliers, creditors, and customers.
      ""Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
  concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
  company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
  shares to Waste Management,"" said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
      ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
  shareholders against abusive tactics, such as ""market
  accumulations by Waste Management or others.""
      Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
  distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
  common.
      ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
  common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
  commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
  shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
      It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
  they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
  board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
  prior to their exercise date.
      ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
  purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
      It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
  March 20.

Waste Management made a $270 million tender offer for ChemLawn last week, which ChemLawn's board deemed inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders. ChemLawn's rights plan includes a one-for-one stock purchase right distribution as a dividend, allowing shareholders to buy a share for $1 if any entity acquires 25% or more of the company, except through an all-cash tender offer or an approved acquisition agreement.

  The U.S. Department of
  Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the
  proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
  Airlines Inc.
      ""The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
  competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,"" the
  DOT said in a statement.
      AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
  unit of AMR Corp.
      The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
  Feb. 20.
      American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
  revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
  carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
  nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
  alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
  compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
      The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
  market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
      The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
  reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
  provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
      At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
  said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
  increase or begin service that competed with a merged
  American-AirCal.
      Concerning the 14th, ""While entry may not be possible at the
  Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
  service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
  especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
  provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
  long-haul markets,"" the DOT said.
      The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
  authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
  terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
  building limit future opportunities for expansion.
      The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
  opposing the merger but ""raised no new facts or arguments.""
      Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will
  pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

295,"ENERGY/U.S. OIL OUTPUT
  Energy Secretary John Herrington has
  proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said
  all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close
  White House scrutiny before action is taken.
      One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion
  allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as
  production using enhanced extraction methods.
      Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.
  The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the
  tax code, but would look at the proposal.
      Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along
  with the release last week of the energy department's report on
  energy and the national security.
      The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit
  50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging
  implications for national security.
      He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that
  any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production
  would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not
  cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.
      Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,
  spurring production but fail the second and third.
      He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil 
  workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil
  prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide
  and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.
      A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria
  by not increasing domestic production.
      In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains
  firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.
      Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:
      - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by
  borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if
  oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that
  could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.
      - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It
  would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000
  barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.
      - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical
  expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a
  day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.
      - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to
  spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for
  the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower
  the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.
      Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration
  proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut
  the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.
      He also called again for Congressional approval to explore
  off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion
  barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which
  may hold nine billion barrels.
      Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to 
  amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these
  proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security
  study would make a strong case for the need to help the
  struggling domestic oil industry.
      Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even
  though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to
  raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
  100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.
      This, he said, would further bolster national security in
  case of an oil-supply disruption.
  

","[50, 86]","['nat-gas', 'crude']","Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed various methods to increase US oil production, but acknowledges that these measures will require financial investment from the government. Herrington favors raising the depletion allowance for new oil and gas production, which would cost $200 million annually. Other options to boost production include loan-price guarantees, tax credits for exploration and development, lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage, and the deregulation of natural gas. Herrington also advocates for exploring the continental shelf and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which are believed to hold significant oil reserves. He understands the White House's hesitation to amend the tax code but emphasizes the importance of supporting the domestic oil industry for national security. Additionally, Herrington plans to push for increasing the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, despite previous rejection from the White House."

301,"TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS
  Taiwan's new controls on currency
  inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood
  of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge
  against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.
      The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one
  mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and
  bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any
  other source.
      Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to
  genuine commercial transactions.
      Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all
  outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,
  insurance and royalties, to the central bank.
      But bankers said they believed the new controls would be
  ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into
  smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan's
  flourishing currency black market.
      The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a
  panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the
  past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to
  slow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S.
      The government has denied local press reports Washington is
  pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.
      The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.
      ""I don't think the central bank has a final target,"" said an
  executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said
  they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the
  Taiwan dollar will rise.
      Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.
  Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus
  widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion
  dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.
      Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative
  money flowed into Taiwan in 1986.
      This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more
  than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last
  year and provided further upward pressure on the currency.
      The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against
  the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging
  speculators.
      Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week
  Washington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves
  meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.
      Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the
  currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow
  the local dollar to find its own level.
      ""Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the
  central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want
  to take the risk,"" said one local banker.
      He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary
  measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with
  the exchange rate problem.
      The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt
  around the real issue, he said.
      Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign
  exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.
      ""The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank
  charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,"" said the
  manager of a European bank.
      Economists criticised the controls, saying they could
  antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic
  liberalisation in Taiwan.
      ""Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has
  restricted inflows,"" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers
  da Costa.
      A local banker, who declined to be named, said, ""It's
  basically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against
  the government's liberalisation programme.""
      Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to
  enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,
  treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow
  individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country
  each year.
  

","[5, 51]","['reserves', 'money-fx']","Taiwan has implemented new controls on currency inflows in an attempt to curb speculative money flows due to the local currency's surge against the US dollar. The central bank now requires clearance for large remittances, but traders are no longer obligated to report all outward payments. Bankers believe these controls will be ineffective as businessmen can bypass them through various means. The controls are seen as a response to US pressure for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with the US. Economists estimate a significant amount of speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986, contributing to the surge in foreign exchange reserves and upward pressure on the currency. Local bankers argue that lifting exchange controls and allowing the local dollar to find its own level is the best solution, but the central bank is reluctant to take that risk. The new restrictions are viewed as temporary and bureaucratic, with some economists criticizing them for potentially antagonizing Washington and going against Taiwan's liberalization efforts."

      The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in
  December.
      The decline in January was the biggest for any month since
  July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.
      The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967
  base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for
  plant and equipment.
      A total of six of 10 indicators available for January
  contributed to the decline.
      Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they
  were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer
  goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower
  deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for
  state unemployment insurance.
      Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock
  prices, new business formation, average work week and money
  supply.
      The main factor for the December upward revision was new
  business formation.
      There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the

317,"MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT
  The Australian dollar rose more than 40
  points and money market interest rates retreated on the better
  than expected improvement in the February current account
  deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about
  identifying it as the start of a downward trend.
      The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in
  February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion
  dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.
      The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as
  high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.
      ""It's got 69 cents written all over it,"" one dealer said.
      Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on
  the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30
  points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.
      The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts
  and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one
  billion dlrs for March.
      Banque National de Paris &lt;BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter
  Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and
  interest rates were too high for import substitution and export
  industries.
      Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875
  and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.
      &lt;Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said
  the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at
  2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.
      But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal
  exports remained poor. ""We should remember we are paying
  something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service
  our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near
  term,"" Buttrose said.
      Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln
  dlrs, and added ""Any figure under a billion dollars will be
  acceptable (to the markets).""
      ANZ Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little
  said the big question was whether the improvement in exports
  could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion
  dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.
      Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with
  90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early
  highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.
      Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct
  from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.
      The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said
  the current account data had little impact on trading.

333,"H AND R BLOCK &lt;HRB> SEES GAINS FROM TAX REFORM
  With the April 15 tax return deadline
  less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging
  on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.
      Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are
  expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a
  ""bonanza,"" analysts say.
      ""For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice
  President Tom Bloch said in an interview. ""When Congress
  drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers
  benefit,"" Bloch said.
      ""Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place
  them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their
  hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'"" he said.
  ""Tax forms will look very different next year,"" he added.
      Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's
  fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over
  fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on
  revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987
  earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.
      ""Next year, Block could have a bonanza,"" Buchbinder said.
  Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a
  gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In
  the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,
  up 1.5 pct over the previous year.
      The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln
  individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax
  season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax
  preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according
  to the IRS.
      For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring
  clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,
  there are some changes in the act that will have a negative
  effect, Bloch conceded.
      Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax
  return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In
  addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the
  tax rolls, he said.
      Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to
  offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost
  for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73
  dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up
  about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he
  said.
      Block expects ""some expansion"" this tax season of its
  electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and
  can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by
  how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made
  available for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.
      The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly
  filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in
  the 1986 tax season.
      First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block
  will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.
      Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the
  same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for
  television ads. ""They may get a little more bang for their
  buck,"" he said.
      He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its
  balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could
  be of great benefit to them.
  

",[41],['earn'],"H&R Block, the nation's largest tax preparer, is expected to see gains from the new tax reform, with analysts predicting good financial results for fiscal 1987 and a potential ""bonanza"" in 1988. The company's vice president, Tom Bloch, attributes this to the confusion surrounding the new tax codes, which will likely drive more people to seek professional help. The Internal Revenue Service estimates 100 million individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax season, with professional tax preparers handling over 43 million forms. While some changes in the tax act may have a negative impact on H&R Block, the company is analyzing its pricing and expanding its electronic filing system to offset these effects. The company is also expected to benefit from lower tax rates and increased advertising efficiency in the next fiscal year."

351,"SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS
  Switzerland's economy, combining low
  unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments
  surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
  future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development, OECD, said.
      This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
  fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it
  said.
      The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
  some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
  inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
      The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
  growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
  and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
  last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
      But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
  increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
  unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
  nation OECD area.
      Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
  the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
  rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
  respectively in 1986.
      The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
  year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
  that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
  would shrink in both years.
      But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
  should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
  GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
  improving international balances,"" the OECD said.
      Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
  buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
  years of relative weakness, it noted.
      In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
  to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
  GDP, it added.
      The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
  bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
  last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
  in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
      As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
  investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
  after vigorous growth in 1986.
      But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
  tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
  earners of foreign exchange.
      The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
  accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
  lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
      Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in
  international financial markets give rise to the question
  whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial

368,"QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88
  The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
  slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
  announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
  deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
      The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
  in the last published budget for 1985/86.
      In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
  Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
  spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
      Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
  billion riyals.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
  6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
  projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
      The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
  uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
  decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
  one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
  pct.
      He urged heads of government departments and public
  institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
  did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
  1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
  the country's foreign reserves.
      He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
  allocated for major projects including housing and public
  buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
  communications, electricity and water, industry and
  agriculture.
      No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
  security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
      Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
  barrels per day.
      Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs
  regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
  determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
  wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
  year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.""

372,"OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987
  The 24 nations of the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
  sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year.
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged.
      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  year's 18.4 pct drop.
      The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year
  and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break
  through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in
  1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle
  of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather
  than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
  U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said.
      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that
  if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would
  collapse.
      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis, it said.
      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly
  sick.""
      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
  December, the EIU said.
      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
  competitively-priced dollar.
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.
      However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over
  the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices
  will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first
  time since 1984, the EIU said.
      After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of
  internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in
  1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.
      It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6
  pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.
  

","[83, 34, 86, 51, 42, 33]","['dlr', 'gnp', 'crude', 'money-fx', 'bop', 'trade']","The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of 24 nations, is facing slower economic growth due to sluggish industrial output and trade. The EIU, an independent research organization, has revised the OECD's economic growth forecast for 1987 downward to 2.5% from 2.8% in December. This is due to weaknesses in West Germany, smaller European countries, and Japan, which have been affected by currency appreciation. The OECD is expected to have a current account deficit of $13 billion in 1987 and 1988, largely due to a rise in oil prices. The US current account deficit is also expected to fall slowly, while West Germany and Japan are expected to have payments surpluses. The EIU predicts a drop in oil prices by the end of 1987 and a further decline in the dollar's value, which could lead to a currency crisis and recession if not managed properly. Trade prospects for 1987 are weak, with import growth slowing down and exports affected by weak demand in West Germany and Japan. The EIU also forecasts a modest increase in non-oil commodity prices and a rise in the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures."

380,"LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL
  Leading industrial nations will meet
  again next month to review their accord on currency stability,
  but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now
  the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic
  growth.
      The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly
  suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the
  normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem
  likely to build on that stability.
      A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement
  last month was the main reason markets were calm.
      But he said in an interview that financial markets also
  understood, ""That all six countries concluded that the measures
  to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster
  stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in
  fact what has happened since Paris.""
      Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by
  the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and
  cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.
      Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but
  left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.
      The official refused to comment, however, on whether the
  agreement included a secret pact to consider further
  coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations
  have taken jointly several times in the past year.
      On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
  France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were
  within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic
  conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget
  deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.
      The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in
  future international talks.
      ""I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand
  politically and the stronger he is politically the better off
  we are with the Congress and the better off we are in
  international fora,"" said the official, an Administration
  economic policymaker. ""So it would be beneficial to the
  continued conduct of our initiatives.""
      But the official also said the Administration would resist
  calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target
  Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.
      Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to
  stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached
  1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to
  have intervened to curb sterling's strength.
      International monetary sources say finance ministers and
  central bankers, who will review market performance and their
  own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington
  just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the
  International Monetary Fund.
      The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris
  pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.
      Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,
  while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to
  show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.
      Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently
  when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told
  bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if
  the Fed was ready to follow suit.
      A Reagan Administration official said this would show there
  had been some change in approach on the part of the central
  bank in Germany.
      But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by
  the Fed and the Bundesbank.
      ""If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked
  about it, it would no longer be private,"" said the official, who
  asked not to be identified.
      Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank
  is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the
  major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.
  Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated
  action could be on the April agenda.
   REUTER...
  

",[51],['money-fx'],"The leading industrial nations will meet in April to review their agreement on currency stability, with the US confident that the countries will uphold their commitments to accelerate economic growth. The recent stability in currency markets suggests that the six major industrial countries have successfully managed financial markets, and the upcoming talks aim to build on this stability. The Paris agreement, which included commitments to reduce the US budget deficit and increase economic growth in Japan and West Germany, is credited as the primary reason for the calm markets. The focus on medium-term policy goals and periodic meetings has contributed to this stability. The US is optimistic that these changes will strengthen their position in international negotiations and resist calls for a tax increase to reduce the budget deficit. However, there are concerns about West German growth and Japan's economic stimulus package, and the possibility of coordinated interest rate cuts remains a topic of discussion."

387,"GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT
  The outlook for the West
  German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
  product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
  University's Institute for World Economy said.
      The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
  economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
  than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
  reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
      In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
  outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
  strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
      ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
  all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise
  in exports can be expected.""
      The institute said past experience has shown West German
  exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
  cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
  their product ranges.
      They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
  economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
  decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
  this year.
      West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
  advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
  of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
  policy, the institute said.
      However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
  improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
  additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
  agreed reductions in working hours.
      The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
  monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
  acceleration of inflation.
      It also warned that what it called the worldwide
  synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
  global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
  countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
  Reserve Board's expansionary course.
      The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
  eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
  Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
  were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
  aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
  increase protectionism around the world.
      Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
  negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
  policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
  growth at home.
      The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
  fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
  should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
  wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
  in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
  pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
  to about four pct.
  

",[34],['gnp'],"The economic outlook for West Germany is optimistic, with a forecast of 3% growth in gross national product for 1987. This is due to a combination of factors, including strong exports, slight economic growth in industrial countries, and increased domestic consumption and investment spending. However, the labor market is expected to see only a slight improvement due to higher labor costs. The expansionary monetary policy may lead to increased inflation and a possible global recession, but West Germany can mitigate these risks by implementing policies that encourage work and investment, reducing taxes, and controlling inflation through money supply management."

409,"U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS
  U.S. retail sales rose sharply in
  February but many economists said the underlying consumer
  spending trend remains weak.
      February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0
  pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's
  sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously
  reported 5.8 pct decline.
      ""The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a
  much more sluggish pace,"" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu
  Capital Markets Inc.
      Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data
  over past four months to show that the pace of consumer
  spending is slowing.
      Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November
  and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain
  over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4
  pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.
      ""You can see a pattern developing,"" Maude said. ""I wouldn't
  be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales
  probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in
  February.""
      Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were
  impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding
  autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline
  in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.
      ""The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains
  in durable goods as well as non-durables,"" noted Ward McCarthy
  of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ""It was a pretty healthy
  report.""
      He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February
  after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store
  sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.
      ""There are signs of life in the economy,"" McCarthy said.
  ""But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report
  into the future."" 
      A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January
  which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost
  spending in February, he said.
      ""A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding
  taxes from their paychecks,"" he said. ""When people in this
  country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination
  is to go out and spend it,"" he said.
      Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for
  the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of
  how much this sector will add to first quarter spending.
       Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total
  February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop
  in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely
  to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws
  January 1, the Commerce Department noted.
      Some economists argued that the because the gain in total
  sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the
  strength in the February report is less than impressive.
      ""There is strength in the February data, but that's because
  they were compared to low sales levels in January,"" said said
  Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ""We don't see it as a
  precursor of continued strength.""
      Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling
  17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained
  1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.
      Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,
  following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher
  oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales
  probably accounted for these gains.
      Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending
  is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion
  dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they
  fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in
  February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.
      ""On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln
  dlrs in the first quartrer,"" she said. ""We don't look at this
  as indication that the economy is barrelling along.""
      ""The number is not really that problematic for those of us
  who are constructive on the bond market,"" agreed Elliot Platt
  of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
      Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary
  policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.
      ""The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so
  confusing,"" he said.
      ""Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll
  employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in
  March,"" he said. ""But now Fed officials will have to wait for
  the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in
  April to sort things out.""
  

",[69],['retail'],"The U.S. retail sales report for February showed a sharp increase of 4.1%, but economists are cautious about the underlying consumer spending trend, which remains weak. The rise in sales was driven by a 14.4% increase in auto sales, which followed a significant drop in January due to tax law changes. Excluding auto sales, total sales rose by 1.5%, with gains in both durable and non-durable goods. However, some economists argue that the February data is not a reliable indicator of future strength, as it follows low sales in January. The trend in consumer spending is weakening, with average retail sales in the first quarter expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 1986. Economists are also awaiting the release of U.S. auto sales data for the first 10 days of March to gauge the sector's impact on first-quarter spending."

421,"PHILLIPS &lt;P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT
  Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize
  improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt,
  C.J. ""Pete"" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.
      ""Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets
  already installed,"" he said, but he declined to estimate annual
  cash flow for 1987.
      Analysts estimate Phillips"" cash flow at over one billion
  dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from
  restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers
  about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.
       Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising
  the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas
  properties.
      ""We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash
  flow prospects,"" he said. He projected a capital expenditure
  budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln
  dlrs.
      Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and
  production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas
  said.
      ""Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the
  waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to
  improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,"" Silas
  said.
       Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to
  cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross
  barrels of oil over a period of 24 years.
      Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas
  said he was seeking ""a modification of terms with the Chinese
  government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang
  fields) commercially viable.""
      In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point
  Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. ""We
  expect to start up the first platform then,"" Silas said.
      But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the
  company to part with several oil and gas assets.
      Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.
  North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in
  1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is
  now completed, Silas said.
       ""We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good
  value for us but possibly so for someone else,"" Silas said.
      Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings
  for the company.
      ""Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we
  are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while
  regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,"" Silas said.
      He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil
  prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for
  several months. ""Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of
  assets), and we're no different from the others,"" Silas said.
      In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from
  Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in
  earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.
      ""This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and
  demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs
  for our operations,"" Silas said, ""In 1987 we think the market's
  supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock
  and energy costs will rise due to price recovery.""
  

","[50, 86, 41]","['nat-gas', 'crude', 'earn']","Phillips Petroleum Co. is prioritizing improving its short-term cash flow in 1987 to reduce its long-term debt, which currently stands at $5.9 billion.

Phillips will invest in waterflooding in Norway and jack up the Ekofisk oil fields to increase oil recovery and earnings. They are also seeking opportunities in China and the U.S. to boost production. In order to manage cash flow and debt, Phillips sold high-cost producing assets worth $1.3 billion in 1986, and they do not plan to sell any more assets this year unless oil prices drop significantly. The company also expects improved earnings from its chemical operations due to a favorable supply and demand balance, despite rising feedstock and energy costs."

  Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board

      Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of

  capital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no

      &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was

  to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.

  a separate holding company.

440,"NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY
  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
  Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
  stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
      Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
  tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
  be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
  16 billion marks from the system.
      The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
  festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
  close banks here this afternoon.
      Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
  unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
  needs at the tender.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
  liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
      But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
  this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
      ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
  a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
      ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
  need is clearer,"" he added.
      An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
  marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
  drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
      Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
  Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
  clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
      Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
  yesterday.
  

","[51, 32]","['money-fx', 'interest']","The Bundesbank is not expected to make any changes to its credit policies at the upcoming central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized. The focus in the money market is on a securities repurchase pact tender, which will provide funds to compensate for the expiration of a previous pact and maintain liquidity. The tender was announced early due to carnival festivities closing banks, making it challenging for banks to determine their reserve requirements. The Bundesbank aims to inject sufficient liquidity to keep short-term rates down, but the uncertainty surrounding banks' current holdings may result in a smaller allocation, with potential adjustments at the next tender.

449,"SOLAR SYSTEMS &lt;SSDN>, INKEY OF SPAIN SET PACT
  Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it
  agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell
  condoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain.
      It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an
  ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of
  AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German
  publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was
  about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the
  condoms made by INKEY.
      The company also said it is changing its name to
  Eurocapital Corp shortly.
      Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a
  U.S.-based &lt;Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own
  the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to
  distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are
  being developed by INKEY.
      The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for
  the distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30
  days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug
  Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file
  with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
  process to be a lengthy one.
      The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
  currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
  to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
  tested in a spermicide.
      Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
  name, ""Carlton."" The exclusive distribution contract for the
  products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year
  periods, the company said.
      It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
  not gone on sale in other European countries.
      It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the
  resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
  or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from
  the FDA.
      The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to
  acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little
  or no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through, Solar
  Systems' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below
  its current 45 pct.

457,"BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES
  This week's Bank of England resistance to
  strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
  holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
      But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
  Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
  broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
  said.
      Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
  trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
  Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
      Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
      A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
  a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
  therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
      Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
  Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
  trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this action
  over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
  distance of that range,"" he said.
      Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
  broad target range around this area.
      However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
  pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
  a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
      ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
  are, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executive
  director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
  foreign exchange market.
      Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
  selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
  general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
  keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
      The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
  1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
      But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
  heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
  holds around these levels.
      He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
  rate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say they
  ought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said.
      Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" being
  invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
  or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
  notice.
      However, the authorities will hope that at least a
  proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
      ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
  have to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey,
  economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
      He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
  sterling, at least in the near term.
      However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
  about March 17, Budget Day.
      The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
  Budget, said Temperton.
      The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
  run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
  bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
      ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
  He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
  cut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
  equities arm of Mercury International Group.
      Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
  way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
  the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
  Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
      This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
  3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
  since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
      However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
  money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
  as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.
  

",[32],['interest'],"The Bank of England faced strong market pressure to lower interest rates but maintained its base rate at 11%, causing the pound to rise to its highest level since August 19. This rise in the pound's value goes against the Chancellor of the Exchequer's stated policy of wanting a stable sterling. Market analysts suggest that the government has a target range for the trade-weighted index of around 72-73%, and the recent actions of the Bank of England to hold rates have brought the pound close to this range. The authorities hope that some of the buying of sterling reflects long-term investment, as they are cautious about reducing rates too soon and then having to raise them again. Most analysts predict a full-point cut around Budget Day, as the Chancellor aims to delay a rate cut until then to coincide with the expected positive reaction to the Budget."

459,"SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD
  Saudi crude oil output last month fell
  to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
  in January, Gulf oil sources said.
      They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
  terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
  from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
  customers.
      But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
  exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
  from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
      The production figures include neutral zone output but not
  sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
  part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
      Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
  production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
  last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
  a barrel.
      The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
  appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
  entitlements before the month-end.
      Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
  support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
  customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
      The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc
  &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
  last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
      However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
  ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
  come this month, when demand for petroleum products
  traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
  weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
      Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
  reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
  and said it would never sell below official prices.
      The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
  slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
  January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
  refineries.
      They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
  last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
  Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
  at around 200,000 bpd each.
  

",[86],['crude'],"Saudi Arabia's crude oil production in February decreased to 3.5 million barrels per day from 3.8 million in January, according to Gulf oil sources. This decline was less than expected due to a surge in exports in the last week of February. The production figures include neutral zone output but exclude sales from floating storage. Saudi Arabia has an OPEC quota of 4.133 million bpd under a production restraint scheme to support new official oil prices. The sources mentioned that the recent high export levels indicate support for official OPEC prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco. However, the real challenge for Saudi Arabia will be to maintain sales at official prices in a weak market during March when demand typically decreases. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reaffirmed the country's commitment to the December OPEC agreement and not selling below official prices."

467,"FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY
  The chairman of the Federal Reserve
  Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House
  Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals
  scheduled for consideration Wednesday.
      Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a
  proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries
  that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government
  debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms
  abroad.
      He added, ""even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to
  be particularly directed,"" has started opening its markets.
      In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also
  said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries
  by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to
  commercial banks, was a problem.
      ""I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine
  the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to
  achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the
  policies that are followed on servicing external debt,"" Volcker
  said.
      It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to
  extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.
      Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary
  James Baker ""about the inappropriateness of using public
  resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we
  both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international
  debt facility.""
      He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures
  for international negotiations on currency exchange rates ""is
  unrealistic and could well have damaging effects.""
      ""For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations
  in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar
  -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference
  among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially
  destabilizing market expectations,"" Volcker said.
      He recommended ""we should not lock ourselves into formalized
  procedures for international negotiations"" on exchange rates but
  instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting
  in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives
  and those of major trade allies.
  

","[33, 51]","['trade', 'money-fx']","Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has expressed concerns about several legislative proposals to the House Banking Committee.

  K Mart Corp said its record fiscal
  1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs
  a year ago, marked a ""major turning point"" for the world's
  second biggest retailer.
      K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
  January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from 
  ""merchandising, refurbishing and expense control.""
      A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for
  discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail
  operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a
  share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.
      K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said ""the success of these
  programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase
  in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
  to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached
  this milestone.""
      Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8
  billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior
  year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
  operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over
  1985, it said.
      Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
  acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, ""a marked increase
  in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
  specialty retailing operations.""
      K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from
  continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from
  372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8
  pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in
  1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.
      K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct
  from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and
  administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct
  in 1985.
      ""Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
  Mart,"" Fauber said in a statement.
      ""In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on
  changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
  company.""
      K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store
  remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,
  upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty
  retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured
  its long-term debt.
      ""We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
  slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
  community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,
  our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct
  for the long term,"" the K Mart chairman said.

The company's net earnings rose to $582.3 million, a substantial increase from the previous year's $221.2 million.

K Mart's Chairman, Bernard Fauber, highlighted the success of their initiatives, resulting in a 35.9% increase in income from continuing operations before taxes. The company's sales also reached an all-time high of $23.8 billion, an 8.1% increase, with comparable store sales up 5.5%. K Mart's fourth-quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations rose by 32.3%, and sales increased by 8.8%.

483,"EXXON &lt;XON> OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ROSE IN 1986
  Exxon Corp said in its annual report
  that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace
  all oil and gas produced.
      The company said that it added about four pct to production
  bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based
  largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions
  to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions
  did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.
      The company said that the average price for oil and gas
  declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38
  pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.
      Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986
  fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from
  the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from
  oil sands in Canada.
      Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for
  expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe
  and the Far East.
      But capital expenditures for exploration and production
  were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year
  and further reductions were expected in 1987.
      Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas
  liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached
  a new high of 422,000 bpd.
      The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea
  fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to
  sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower
  quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded
  over the past several years.
      The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon
  more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to
  earnings gains from refining and marketing.
      Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations
  rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs
  in 1985.
      The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043
  mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs
  rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.
      Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500
  mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery
  completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in
  Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes
  to extract higher proportions of light products.
  

","[50, 86]","['nat-gas', 'crude']","Exxon Corporation experienced a productive year in 1986, increasing oil and gas production by 4% to 1.8 million barrels per day, the highest level since 1979. This increase was primarily driven by overseas oil production, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, and Malaysia, as well as oil sands in Canada. However, new discoveries and reserve acquisitions did not fully offset the production levels. The average price of oil and gas decreased by 41% year-over-year, leading to a 38% decline in earnings from exploration and production, which fell to $3.1 billion in 1986 from $4.9 billion in 1985. Exxon acquired 11.2 million acres for exploration across 10 countries, but capital expenditures for exploration and production were reduced to $4.6 billion from the previous year's $7.6 billion, with further cuts expected in 1987. The company's refinery operations saw significant improvements, with earnings rising to nearly $2 billion in 1986, thanks to a successful upgrading program at its Baytown, Texas refinery and a project in Rotterdam, both of which focused on processing lower-grade crudes to produce higher yields of light products."

491,"ALLIED-LYONS SEES NO CHANGE IN HIRAM WALKER STAKE
  Allied-Lyons PLC &lt;ALLD.L> and Canada's
  Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
  currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
  distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons
  chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.
      Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham
  last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'
  &lt;Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact
  after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
  &lt;Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.
      ""We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
  there won't be any change, but there could be,"" Holden-Brown
  told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
      He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could
  force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and
  Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate
  Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.
      ""Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
  for either the put or call to be exercised,"" Holden-Brown said.
      In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it
  would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
  pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. ""I don't
  think we would have any objection to it,"" he added.
      Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's
  board of directors and has total responsibility for its
  management. ""We cannot contemplate giving up our control,"" he
  said.
      Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit
  contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial
  results, but he said ""it will be substantial.""
      ""I am not able to give profit forecasts,"" he said.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the
  Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
  and has no current plans for a stock issue.
      He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
  acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
  possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
  concerns. ""I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery
  scene (which is) highly concentrated already,"" he added.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on
  Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.
  

",[3],['acq'],"Allied-Lyons PLC and the Reichmann brothers are currently content with their joint ownership of distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, with Allied-Lyons holding 51% control and the Reichmanns' Gulf Canada Corp owning 49%. The two parties have a good partnership and do not anticipate any changes in ownership, although there is a two-year call option for Gulf Canada to sell its stake and a put option for Allied-Lyons to buy it. Holden-Brown, Allied-Lyons' chairman, stated that Gulf Canada could potentially sell part of its stake in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. Allied-Lyons maintains control of the board and management of Hiram Walker-Gooderham and expects a substantial profit contribution from the distiller. The company financed the acquisition with cash and borrowings and has no plans for a stock issue, but they are evaluating potential acquisitions in the Canadian market, excluding breweries. Allied-Lyons also intends to list its shares on Canadian stock exchanges later this year."
492,"U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT
  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,
  said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
  1987.
      He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
  payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
  billion shortfall in 1986.
      Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this
  year, Lawson said.
      ""As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may
  continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by
  the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
  year,"" he added.
      Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),
  Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0
  billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.
      The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.
      On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for
  the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal
  1987/88.
      No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3
  aggregate, he said. ""But broad money will continue to be taken
  into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course
  will the exchange rate,"" the Chancellor told Parliament.
      Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 ""is
  chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax
  revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an
  increasingly profitable business sector in particular.""
      On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
  assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
  barrel in calendar 1987.
      He said ""it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax
  revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the
  economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the
  public finances in a very strong position.""
      Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at
  1.0 pct of GDP in future.
      ""We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term
  Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0
  pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years
  ahead,"" Lawson said.
      ""Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this
  year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course
  remains a major objective of government policy.""
      ""But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence
  and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.""
      Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange
  Control Act from the Statute book.
      On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged
  at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be
  charged at the ""appropriate corporation tax rate.""
      He said that under the new proposed system, companies
  should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments
  against tax on capital gains.
      ""Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in
  1988/89,"" Lawson said.
      Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building
  societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation
  tax, ""with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after
  the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.""
      ""I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new
  method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and
  File.""
      This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax
  collection, and would not come into force until the early
  1990s.
      Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax
  (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct
  of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their
  (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those
  new fields exceeds the costs incurred.
      Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending
  on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any
  particular field.
      On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive
  tax relief for retraining workers.
      Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value
  Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax
  on the basis of cash paid and received.
      Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of
  quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being
  extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds
  are to be raised to 21,300 stg.
      New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.
      The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be
  set at 125,000 stg.
      Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies
  in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be
  able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.
  The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but ""genuine
  trading companies"" will not be affected.
      He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit
  relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank
  loans, also from April 1.
      ""In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit
  only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,"" he said.
      The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two
  pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.
      Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic
  taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added ""given my decision
  to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to
  reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.""
      Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to
  27 pct, he said.
      On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to
  change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it
  into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities
  made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable
  provisions made by financial traders.
      The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with
  Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.
      ""The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the
  Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,"" Lawson
  said.

499,"WALL STREET STOCKS/TENNECO INC &lt;TGT>
  Tenneco Inc, a company that has long
  been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today
  when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be
  targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts
  said.
      Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said ""we have no comment to
  make whatsoever."" Pickens was not available for comment.
      Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today
  after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.
      Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.
      Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,
  Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at
  market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover
  attempt.
      ""It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his
  group may be interested,"" Feretti said.
      ""But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its
  sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a
  challenge.""
      Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over
  Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter, has made
  no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas
  reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner
  than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated
  in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.
      Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at
  58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of
  about 10 dlrs a share ""which is probably very attractive to
  Pickens."" Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value
  well into the 60 dlr a share range.
      ""I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile
  takeover,"" Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst
  John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.
      ""Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs
  in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding."" He said the
  buyer would also have to deal with ""the intractable problems""
  Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy
  businesses.
      Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of
  defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as
  spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to
  shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership
  out of its natural gas pipeline interests.
      An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged
  the Pickens rumor. ""Pickens has a plateful already with his
  holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess,"" he said. ""I
  don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems
  with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing
  about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion
  dlrs on the market today.""
  

",[3],['acq'],"Speculation is circulating that investor T. Boone Pickens may be planning to acquire Tenneco Inc, a company known for its significant natural gas reserves. The company's stock price rose following rumors of a potential takeover, but Tenneco declined to comment. Analysts have varying opinions on the likelihood of a hostile takeover, with some citing the company's large debt and operational challenges as deterrents. Tenneco could employ defensive strategies to prevent an unwanted acquisition, such as spinning off non-energy businesses or creating a limited partnership. However, some analysts doubt Pickens' interest due to his existing commitments and Tenneco's farm equipment unit's struggles."
500,"AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS
  American Express Co, rumored to be
  considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
  said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
  that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
  broadening international competition.
      In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
  the actions under consideration are an integral part of
  American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
  that the two companies have been having both internal and
  external discussions on the matters.
      American Express said no decision has been reached on the
  strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
  decide to follow growth plans already in place.
      Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
  financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
  Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
  selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
  speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
  the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
      There was some speculation that American Express had also
  considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
  considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
       American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
  will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
  would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
  silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
  Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
  to a Friday close at 74.
       It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
  similar statement was being circulated to employees.
      Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
  American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
  brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
  pct in the last year.
      Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
  off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
  price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
       Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
  1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
      American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
  may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
  of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
  Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
      To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
  ""(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
  capital if they need to,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of
  Prudential-Bache Securities.
      Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
  Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
  Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
       The reorganization also created four new positions for
  chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
  speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
       Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
  little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
  confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
  unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
  acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
  growth and positioning in the global market competition.
      Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
  Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
  there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
  it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.        
  

",[3],['acq'],"American Express is considering various strategic options for its brokerage unit, Shearson Lehman Brothers, to improve its access to capital and compete internationally. While no decision has been made, options include spinning off part of Shearson, selling a stake to a Japanese firm, or offering a public stake. Analysts are divided on the potential benefits, with some suggesting the move could increase the value of Shearson, while others question the need for additional capital. The company's recent management reorganization and market speculation indicate that American Express is exploring growth opportunities beyond its current strategy, but no official decision has been announced."

      European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq
  meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three
  major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan
  -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.
      Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters
  bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of
  the world was no way to solve trade disputes.
      New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues
  great progress had been made in preparing for the current round
  of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.
      The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum
  towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.
      Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was
  that they tended to get bogged down for years. ""Countries don't
  get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day
  which is, maybe, five or six years in the future.""
      He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as
  protectionist as it was 18 months ago. ""That's a very healthy
  development,"" he added.""If you asked me about that a year or 18
  months ago I would have said that it was terribly
  protectionist.""
      ""Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of
  Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer
  to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit,"" Yeutter said.
      ""They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate
  solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are
  more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that
  issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago.""
      He added, ""Whether that will be reflected in the legislation
  that eventually emerges is another matter.""
  

",[33],['trade'],"Clayton Yeutter, the US Trade Representative, believes that the US and Japan are on the verge of a serious trade conflict due to various issues, including semiconductors, Japan's reluctance to purchase US supercomputers, and barriers for US firms in the Kansai airport project. This conflict, along with similar tensions between the EC and Japan, could negatively impact other GATT members, according to European Community commissioner Willy de Clercq. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins and New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore emphasize the importance of resolving trade disputes without bilateral retaliation and maintaining progress towards fresh GATT negotiations. Yeutter notes that international trade talks often take years to reach a conclusion, and he expresses cautious optimism about the new US Congress being less protectionist than before, acknowledging that legislative solutions to trade deficits may not be effective."
504,"RAIMOND EXPECTS EC-GULF PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED
  French Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard
  Raimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to
  negotiations to admit Gulf petrochemical exports into the
  European Community (EC).
      Negotiations have been under way between the Community and
  the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for three years.
      Raimond, due here tomorrow from Oman for his first official
  visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told the semi-official
  daily Al-Ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be
  reached.
      ""I am confident that problems between the two big partners,
  the GCC and the EC, will find a solution. I will work to reach
  that solution,"" he said in the interview conducted in Paris.
      An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical
  exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between
  the two sides.
      GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE
  and Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on
  European exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached.
      Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a
  long time because there were 20 countries involved. But added:
  ""Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for
  making crucial progress.""
      Referring to the Iran-Iraq war, he said efforts should
  continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties.
      He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some
  problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others
  remained unresolved. He gave no details but said: ""France wishes
  to have normal relations with Iran.""

Raimond attributed the lengthy negotiations to the involvement of 20 countries but believes a solution is imminent. He also addressed the Iran-Iraq war, advocating for continued efforts to find a resolution and mentioning France's ongoing negotiations with Iran."

  rates on existing debt, renegotiating loans or debt
  forgiveness. The bill would give a blanket waiver of any
  federal banking regulations that bar such actions.

  discuss with debt-ridden developing countries the possibility
  of the U.S. setting up a public debt management agency that
  would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the
  restructuring of the debt.

      Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
  soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
  weekly crush number.
      However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
  with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
  in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
  few months.
      U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
  demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
  than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
  an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
      Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
  weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
  nearby March contract today.
      ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
  May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
  which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush
  trader said.
      ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March
  has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
  tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added.
      As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
  ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
  fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
  bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
  days.
      The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
  processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
  level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
  back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
      With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
  premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
      A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
  for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
  sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
  the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
      Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
  little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
  processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
  it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.
  

","[21, 85, 60, 40, 70, 37]","['soy-meal', 'soy-oil', 'soybean', 'meal-feed', 'oilseed', 'veg-oil']","Soybean crush ratios have recently declined, leading to reduced output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly crush rate has decreased, with a current rate of 21.78 million bushels, down from 22 million bushels over the past two months. This decline is attributed to a decrease in export demand and weak domestic livestock feed demand due to a milder winter. Soybean meal futures have also dropped, with the March contract reaching a new low. Crush margins have been negatively impacted, causing some processors to reduce production to balance supply and demand. The March crush ratio has fallen significantly, and with the May crush ending at an unprofitable level, processors are aiming to avoid locking in at that ratio. Additionally, processors are having to pay premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing their margins. A central Illinois processor is operating at a loss, and if the situation persists, more plants may consider temporary shutdowns to address the unprofitable margins."
522,"WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA
  World Bank President Barber Conable is
  expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest
  debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to
  tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.
      Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will
  meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.
      He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's
  largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world
  oil prices called for major policy adjustments.
      Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects
  in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous
  island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed
  discussions with ministers tomorrow.
      Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely
  hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and
  gas revenues in half.
      Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to
  provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia
  pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.
      Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to
  the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31
  pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to
  bridge its deficit.
      Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto
  and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy
  change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
  protected economy.
      ""Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call
  for major policy adjustments and external support,"" Conable said
  in his arrival statement.
      But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next
  month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that
  the Bank is demanding specific changes.
      ""We believe there has been wise leadership here and the
  economy is being very well managed,"" Conable told reporters at
  Jakarta airport.
      Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling
  37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the
  Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7
  billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.
      Conable did not spell out what further changes he would
  like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes
  already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.
      Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,
  the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the
  government's trade reform measures, and supported its
  determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.
      Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last
  May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage
  outside investment.
      Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look
  into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be
  sold.
      But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the
  government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.
      Western analysts say that in particular the government is
  unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost
  monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.
      Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that
  Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.
      It could not spend its way out of trouble because this
  would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic
  inflation.
       He said the main objective was to raise exports outside
  the oil and natural gas sector.
      Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the
  government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial
  year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in
  1986/87.
  

",[86],['crude'],"World Bank President Barber Conable is visiting Indonesia to discuss the country's economic situation and policy changes in response to the decline in oil revenues. Indonesia, the third-world's sixth-largest debtor, has been significantly impacted by the drop in oil prices, leading to a reduction in oil and gas revenues. The country has responded by cutting spending, devaluing its currency, and promoting exports, while also relying on foreign loans. Conable is expected to encourage President Suharto and economic ministers to continue these reforms, especially in dismantling Indonesia's protected economy. Indonesia, with a population of 168 million, has the third world's sixth-biggest debt and has received significant support from the World Bank and Japan's Export-Import Bank. The government is considering selling some of its state-run companies, but there are internal divisions over the extent of reforms. Analysts suggest that the government is hesitant to fully dismantle high-cost monopolies that control key economic sectors."

531,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87.

  of return,"" said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who
  was also at the meeting.
      Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically
  act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs
  to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.
      Henderson said the major new products in the company's
  pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs
  annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,
  Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,
  a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
      Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
  to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing
  agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected until
  about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin
  in the U.S. later this year.
      Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986
  income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15
  billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.
      Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden
  Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a
  unit of Hanson Industries Inc.
      Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs
  available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40
  acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more
  acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an
  acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as ""too expensive.""
      Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective
  April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who
  will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the
  earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years
  after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.
  

","[3, 41]","['acq', 'earn']","ICI, the largest chemical company in the UK, plans to expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses in 1987. The company aims to shift towards higher value-added businesses and broaden its base, according to chairman-elect Denys Henderson. ICI has announced the formation of a new US drug company, ICI Pharma, which will double its current pharmaceutical sales to $1.1 billion by 1990. Henderson believes that ICI's pharmaceutical business is overshadowed by Glaxo's, despite being the second largest drug maker in the UK. In 1986, US drug sales accounted for 40% of ICI's worldwide drug sales of $1.5 billion, which brought in 27% of its total profits. By 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division is expected to account for about 30% of total company profits. The new US drug company will act as a second sales force to increase exposure to doctors, with 145 new salespeople to be hired by October. ICI's major new products in development are Statil, Zoladex, and Carwin, each expected to bring in over $200 million in annual sales. Henderson expects the company's 1987 results to surpass 1986's income of $888 million on sales of $15 billion, boosted by the acquisition of Glidden Paints. ICI has $9 billion available for acquisitions, with more acquisitions planned for 1987, but Henderson rules out a pharmaceutical acquisition as too expensive. Henderson's biggest challenge as chairman is to maintain the company's earnings momentum after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses."

  USX Corp chairman David Roderick said
  the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
  about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has
  no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.
      ""We have terminated our discussions,"" Roderick told Reuters
  after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
  here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other
  possible buyer of its energy assets.
      Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per
  share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD> publicly held stock.
      USX said in December the company had held formal
  discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its
  overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of
  interest from a half dozen other oil companies.
      Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no
  immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas
  Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of
  its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.
      ""We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field
  during these difficult times,"" Roderick added.
      In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not
  know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was
  accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested
  Holmes a Court was buying additional shares.
      Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion
  dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold
  a sizable interest in the company. ""Mr. Ichan still apparently
  has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,""
  Roderick said. ""He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I
  talk with him monthly.""
      In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of
  the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade
  deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.
      ""I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net
  trade surplus,"" Roderick said. ""I think the worst is over and
  we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.""
      However, the USX chairman warned that European trading
  partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. ""Some
  economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States
  to our friends, trading partners and allies.""

      Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring
  featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the

556,"TIME &lt;TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE
  Time Inc's chief financial officer,
  Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is
  ""comfortable"" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings
  will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.
      In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,
  including a number of special items.
      Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special
  items and also removing the earnings of American Television and
  Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in
  1986.
      Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the
  cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly
  in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in
  Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.
      Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a
  Turner Broadcasting spokesman said.
      Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously
  announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back
  4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were
  purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of
  81 dlrs per share.
      Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback
  program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term
  investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not
  give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln
  shares already announced.
     
      On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and
  chief executive said the company is not interested in investing
  in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all
  areas in which it is currently engaged.
      Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.
  In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest
  acquisition ever.
      N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
  the company might be interested in a relatively small book
  business.
      He said following the recent agreement for the sale of
  Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, ""there may be pieces
  that Murdoch doesn't want,"" referring to News Corp chairman
  Rupert Murdoch.
      Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro
  said it is a ""delicate subject"", and ""we're looking at all the
  options."" SAMI is a marketing information service for the food
  industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as
  much as 500 mln dlrs.
     
      Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers
  last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of
  1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be
  down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a
  special gain in the HBO unit.
      Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber
  growth of 800,000 for last year.
      He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under
  50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and
  higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the
  tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.
      Munro said the company does not plan to increase its
  dividend.
      Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American
  Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at
  getting involved in the home shopping video area. ""It would be
  foolish not to be a player there,"" he said.
      He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network
  Inc &lt;HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year,
  but nothing came of the talks.

  Taiwan's industrial production index,
  fell, largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar, by
  8.18 pct to 140.06 (base 1981) in February from a revised
  152.53 in January, the Economy Ministry said.
      It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after dropping
  nine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February
  1986 following a very extended rise last year.
      The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82.
      A ministry official attributed the decline to falling
  production of non-metal products, textiles and transportation
  equipment, and less mining and house construction.
      The official said the decline was also caused by falling
  exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar,
  which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.
      He expected the decline to continue in the next few months
  because of further appreciation of the local dollar against the
  U.S. Currency.
      The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against the
  U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to the

  &lt;WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB
  International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6
  mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.
      WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to
  WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.
      The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record
  profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to
  changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also
  allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of
  1987 developed positively, it added.
      WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for
  international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in
  1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the
  balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.
      Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln
  in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from
  10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that
  credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new
  lending.
      The statement said WestLB International's business with
  private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.
      This development was aided by cooperation between the bank
  and the savings banks in the West German state of North
  Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.
      Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of
  1.1 billion.

  services for private clients.

578,"LOWER U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED
  U.S. soybean lobbyists and
  congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior
  Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.
  soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per
  bushel next year.
      ""I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.
  Politically it would be totally unacceptable,"" an aide to a
  senior farm-state senator said.
      USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that
  Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan 
  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather
  than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.
      ""I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,""
  American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.
      Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if
  the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider
  ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.
      His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the
  administration's position is in the debate over what should be
  done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect
  soybean farmers' income.
      Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the
  loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been
  pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices
  competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to
  maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move
  would be too costly.
      ""There will be alot of other options that will be
  considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz
  proposal,"" said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan
  (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.
      ""Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers
  would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean
  loan,"" O'Conner said.
      Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and
  decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr
  basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to
  increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.
  Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a
  soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or
  4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.
  

","[60, 70]","['soybean', 'oilseed']","The U.S. soybean loan proposal by a senior Agriculture Department official has faced sharp criticism from soybean lobbyists and congressional aides. The proposal suggests lowering the soybean loan level to $4.56 per bushel, which has been met with political resistance. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz believes keeping the loan at its effective rate of $4.56 would allow for exploring ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive. However, this idea has been opposed by the American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard and others, who argue that it would negatively impact soybean farmers' income. There are alternative suggestions to improve soybean competitiveness, such as soybean-specific certificates or a marketing loan, but these options have their own challenges. The soybean loan proposal is generally seen as unpopular among representatives of soybean producers, and Congress may consider other options to enhance soybean competitiveness while maintaining farmer income."

589,"JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER
  The Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further
  slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its
  semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.
      The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the
  semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price
  Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to
  take retaliatory action after April 1.
      The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling
  cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of
  American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.
      MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been
  pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will
  boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.
      Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to
  reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,
  they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks
  of the first quarter.
      If that reduced production level were maintained through to
  the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct
  below that of the first three months of the year.
      MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the
  ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second
  quarter cutback.
      One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in
  Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there
  are picking up.
      MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese
  semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts
  to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.
  

",[33],['trade'],"Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) plans to request a further reduction in output from Japanese computer microchip manufacturers for the second quarter, aiming to preserve their semiconductor agreement with the United States. This move comes as the US accuses Japan of violating the pact by continuing to sell low-cost chips in Asian markets. MITI aims to increase domestic chip prices and reduce exports by limiting production. They previously asked for a 10% output reduction in the first quarter, and a similar or potentially larger cut is expected for the second quarter. Japanese chip makers are facing increased competition from South Korea and the US in Asian markets, and some have privately criticized MITI for their handling of the situation."

  Standard Oil Co expects the sale of

      Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations
  dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and
  3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices.
      The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>

  capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion
  dlrs projected in January.
      Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in
  1986.
      The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41
  billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a
  year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4
  mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985.
      But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet
  from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic
  feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during
  1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion
  cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added.
      Standard said both oil and gas production increased last
  year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the
  previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in
  1985.
      But the average sales price of both dropped -- to 13.83
  dlrs per barrel from 26.43 dlrs for oil in 1985 and to 1.49
  dlrs per thousand cubic feet from 2.18 dlrs a year earlier.

608,"TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL
  Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost
  three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
  proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
      However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
  the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
  high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
  would agree to a takeover.
      ""There are too many uncertainties,"" said one arbitrager.
      Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
      Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
  Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
  were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
  and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
  dlrs per share.
      The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
  to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
  made on a sale of the company.
      ""Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
  share),"" said one arbitrager.
      Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
  levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
  range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
  would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
  transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
  necessary for the broadcast properites.
      Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
  dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
  the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
  its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
  such as restructuring.
      Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
  which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
  Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
  Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
  16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
  years ago, has about 12 pct.
      Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
  Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
      ""I could see if things got really crazy that it might go
  for 175 (dlrs per share),"" said one arbitrager, but he
  speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more
  than a price in the 160s.
      Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he
  speculated the investor would not really be interested in
  running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.
      Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
  he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged
  buyout.
      ""Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all
  the interests involved,"" he said, adding the two largest
  shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.
      He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the
  company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest
  estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the
  latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the
  broadcast industry.

616,"U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN
  The U.S. is urging reluctant
  commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel
  Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes
  the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt
  strategy, a Reagan administration official said.
      The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas
  for interest rate concessions should be treated much more
  seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing
  nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.
      In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to
  reconsider the idea of a ""megabank,"" where Third World debt would
  be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such
  a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the
  same time, however, the official expressed reservations that
  such a scheme would ever get off the ground.
      The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine
  suggestions that ""exit bonds"" be issued to end the troublesome
  role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to
  underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,
  the official said in an interview with Reuters.
      ""All of these things would fit within the definition of our
  initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and
  unique approach such as those should be considered,"" said the
  official, who asked not to be named.
      In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy
  under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such
  as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.
      In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact
  economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.
      ""The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors
  have been performing well,"" said the official. But he admitted
  that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an
  exception.
      The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.
  Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,
  also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve
  their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.
      ""We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications
  to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more
  effectively,"" the official said.
      Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that
  commercial banks create a ""megabank"" which could swap Third World
  debt paper for so-called ""exit bonds"" for banks like regional
  American or European institutions.
      Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to
  lend money to their former debtors every time a new money
  package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in
  its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.
      He emphasised that the ""megabank"" was not an administration
  plan but ""something some people have suggested.""
      Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are
  examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third
  World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would
  differ slightly from the one the official described.
      But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan
  would work in the United States.
      ""If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,
  fine. I don't think they ever will.""
      He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World
  loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant
  to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.
      Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under
  which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no
  more than 5/8 pct above Libor.
      ""The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite
  unique and I don't think it's something that should be
  categorically rejected out of hand,"" the official said.
      Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be
  offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin
  above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment
  Notes.
      These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a
  six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before
  maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point
  over Libor.
      Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too
  low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at
  stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and
  granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled
  debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support
  in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last
  year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.
      But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate
  capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the
  banks. ""It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you
  have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed
  before,"" the official said in comments suggesting some ought to
  be granted the rate concessions they seek. ""Some people argue

      He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an
  initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.
  

",[32],['interest'],"The U.S. is encouraging commercial banks to consider a novel Philippine proposal for managing its interest payments, emphasizing that it aligns with the U.S. Third World debt strategy. This strategy involves increased lending from banks and multilateral institutions to major debtor nations, coupled with economic reforms to promote growth. The Philippine plan includes cash interest payments at a rate slightly above Libor, with an alternative option of Libor payments and Philippine Investment Notes. This approach is seen as a creative solution to the Third World debt crisis, and the U.S. believes it should be given serious consideration. The official suggests that interest rate concessions should be taken into account when debtors demonstrate genuine economic reforms. The Philippine proposal, along with Argentina's idea of ""exit bonds,"" aims to strengthen the role of private banks in the debt strategy. The U.S. also expresses support for the concept of a ""megabank"" to pool Third World debt, although the official doubts its feasibility in the U.S. The Philippine plan is praised for its uniqueness and potential to address the debt crisis, while the official clarifies that it does not constitute interest rate capitalization."

620,"JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES
  Japan is expected to cut the base lending
  rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
  part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
  Finance Ministry sources said.
      They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
  Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
  abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
  the bureau.
      The bureau channels funds to government financial
  institutions for public works and other official uses, they
  said.
      The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
  Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
  corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
  tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
      However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
  to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
  Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
      The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
  market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
  domestic economy, they said.
      On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
  their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
  The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
  using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
  Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
  the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
      These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
  should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
  the ministry sources said.
      Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
  percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

The bureau is responsible for channeling funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official purposes. The base lending rate for state bodies, such as the Japan Development Bank and the People's Finance Corp, typically follows long-term prime rates, but the last cut could not be implemented due to the legal minimum rate set by the Trust Fund Bureau. The ministry aims to abolish this minimum rate and introduce a market-related rate to stimulate the domestic economy. Long-term bankers have already been allowed to reduce their prime rate to 5.5%, and the ministry is in discussions with depositors using the bureau, postal savings system, and Japan welfare annuity to determine the appropriate market rates for setting the bureau's deposit rate. Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, are likely to be chosen."

  chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to
  maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in
  1987 as the company has for the past five years.
      ""We expect the same performance in net income over the next
  five years as we have had in the past,"" Ziering said.
      Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
  average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
  pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
  had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
  mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
      Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
  test kits.
      Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
  positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
  sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
  he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
  more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
  depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
      Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
  the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
  income in 1987.

638,"BOND DEFERS RIGHTS ISSUE, MULLS PROJECT PARTNERS
  &lt;Bond Corp International Ltd>, a
  subsidiary of the Australian-based Bond Corp Holdings Ltd
  &lt;BONA.S>, said it would defer its planned rights issue but
  still wants the issue to be made before July 31.
      No date has been set for the issue, announced in January.
      In a document to shareholders, Bond Corp said the delay
  follows its receipt of a 240 mln H.K. Dlr loan from its parent
  company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond
  Centre commercial complex in central Hong Kong.
      It also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the
  project, the company said.
      The January announcement said the rights issue would
  finance Bond Corp's 1.4 billion dlr acquisition of a 23.77 pct
  stake in HK-TVB Ltd &lt;TVBH.HK> from film magnate Run Run Shaw.
      The company then reached an agreement with a consortium led
  by Sino Land Co Ltd &lt;SINO.HK> to buy a commercial complex that
  is still under construction for 1.9 billion dlrs.
      Bond International said in the document that except for the
  240 mln dlr loan, the deal would be financed from internal
  resources and by selling an interest in the building.
      The payments must be completed by the end of 1987.
      Bond International has also sold several residential
  buildings in Hong Kong's mid-levels district for a total of
  68.35 mln dlrs, the statement said.
      The flats were among the properties it bought last year
  from Hongkong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HK> for 1.4 billion dlrs.
      Analysts said Bond International is heavily geared as it
  has relied on bank borrowings to purchase both the Hongkong
  Land properties and the HK-TVB shares.
      Bond International also said in the document that while it
  plans to sell an interest in the complex it will hold the
  HK-TVB shares as a long-term investment.
  

",[3],['acq'],"Bond Corp International Ltd, a subsidiary of Bond Corp Holdings Ltd, has decided to postpone its planned rights issue but aims to complete it before July 31st. The delay is due to a loan received from its parent company to cover the initial payment for the Bond Centre commercial complex in Hong Kong. Bond International is considering bringing in external partners to take up to 50% of the project. The rights issue was initially intended to finance the acquisition of a stake in HK-TVB Ltd from Run Run Shaw, followed by the purchase of a commercial complex from a consortium led by Sino Land Co Ltd. Bond International plans to finance the deal through internal resources and by selling a portion of the building, while retaining the HK-TVB shares as a long-term investment. The company has also sold several residential buildings in Hong Kong's mid-levels district, which were part of the properties acquired from Hongkong Land Co Ltd last year. Analysts note that Bond International is highly leveraged due to its reliance on bank loans for these acquisitions."

641,"NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY
  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
  Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
  stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
      Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
  tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
  be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
  16 billion marks from the system.
      The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
  festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
  close banks here this afternoon.
      Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
  unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
  needs at the tender.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
  liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
      But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
  this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
      ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
  a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
      ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
  need is clearer,"" he added.
      An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
  marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
  drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
      Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
  Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
  clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
      Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
  yesterday.
  

","[51, 32]","['money-fx', 'interest']","The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, is not expected to change its credit policies at the upcoming central bank council meeting on Thursday. This is due to the stabilization of exchange rates and short-term interest rates in recent weeks. The focus in the money market is on a securities repurchase pact tender, which will provide funds on Thursday to offset the expiration of a previous pact, resulting in a 16 billion mark liquidity drain. The tender was announced early due to carnival festivities closing banks in Duesseldorf and Frankfurt. The minimum reserve figures for the month's start are inaccurate due to carnival disruptions, making it challenging for banks to determine their requirements for the tender. The Bundesbank aims to maintain sufficient liquidity to keep short-term rates low. However, uncertainty about banks' current holdings may lead the Bundesbank to allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, with the possibility of topping up at the next tender. Dealers speculate that the Bundesbank might reduce the amount to around 14 or 15 billion marks, with plans to increase it at the following tender when the demand is clearer. An earlier pact expiration will drain 8.5 billion marks, and banks also face a temporary drain from a significant tax deadline for customers.

642,"ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT
  Aluminium capacity expansion planned for
  the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any
  acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the
  scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird
  Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review.
      By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to
  be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln
  tonnes are scheduled, Bird said.
      Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and
  increased imports by less developed countries.
      Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate
  by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world
  consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from
  13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird
  said.
      Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of
  change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed
  this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied
  with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have
  served them well in recent years.
      In order to encourage the construction of additional
  smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher
  level.
      Production costs are likely to rise again in the years
  ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity
  suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,
  according to the review.
      At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price
  scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and
  89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.
      Such a price development is not expected to cause any
  marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely
  rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the
  pipeline for steel and copper.
      In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,
  as the world economy has not responded well to the
  opportunities offered by cheap oil.
      Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4
  pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher
  in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes.
  

",[6],['alum'],"The article discusses the projected growth of the aluminum industry and the potential challenges it may face. According to the analyst Anthony Bird Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review, the planned expansion of aluminum capacity after 1990 will be inadequate to meet the anticipated increase in demand. The article highlights the need for additional capacity, with a projected requirement of 18 million tonnes by 1995, while only 15 million tonnes are currently scheduled. Bird predicts higher economic growth and increased imports, leading to a sharp rise in non-socialist world consumption. The review suggests that aluminum companies may need to adapt their strategies to accommodate the changing market dynamics, and higher aluminum prices may be necessary to encourage the construction of new smelters. Production costs are expected to rise due to the diminishing alumina capacity and potential electricity supply issues. The article also mentions the short-term dull outlook for the world economy and provides forecasts for aluminum consumption and production in 1987."

654,"ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES
  Zambia's talks with the World Bank and
  International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package
  have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an
  official newspaper said.
      The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United
  National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as
  saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing
  food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how
  it proposes to pay for them.
      President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies
  last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move
  caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots
  in which 15 people were killed.
      The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to
  quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the
  government about 500 mln kwacha per year.
      The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the
  government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the
  remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.
      The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to
  the private sector has been suspended since the end of January,
  pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and
  dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.
      The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction
  system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since
  the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine
  per dollar.
      Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank
  and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar
  on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.
      According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by
  assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude
  its talks with the government on schedule on March 23.
      The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its
  talks with the government have taken longer than expected.
  

",[51],['money-fx'],"Zambia's financial negotiations with the World Bank and IMF have encountered challenges regarding food subsidies, with the IMF and World Bank refusing to fund them and requesting an alternative funding plan from the Zambian government. This follows President Kaunda's failed attempt to eliminate maize subsidies, which led to price hikes and riots. The talks also address modifications to Zambia's foreign exchange auction system, aiming to stabilize the kwacha's devaluation. The IMF team, led by Paul Acquah, is expected to complete the discussions on March 23, although the negotiations have taken longer than anticipated."

665,"DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR
  Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
  from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
  Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
  energy industry analysts said.
      Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
  part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
  mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
  pay down debt, analysts said.
      ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
  direction that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analyst
  who asked not to be named.
      Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
  Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
  Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale ""at
  the right price.""
      Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
  billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
  it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
  Encor shares do not pay dividends.
      A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
  whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
      At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
  valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
  shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
      Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
  prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
  Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
      ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
  recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltd
  oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
      ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
  sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
  they have been able to in recent years,"" he added.
      Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
  7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
  dlrs in early February.
      The company also recently set up its own operating
  management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
  Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
      Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So
  (the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said.
      However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
  Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
  proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
  Commerce Bank.
      ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
  they can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
      Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
  block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
      ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
  something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
  sold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert.
      Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
  liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
  Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
      Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
  possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
      Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
  debt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
  holding.
      Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
  would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
  obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
  price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
  but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are very
  attractive.""
  

",[3],['acq'],"Dome Petroleum Ltd is facing pressure from one of its major creditors, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, to sell its significant stake in Encor Energy Corp Ltd to repay a portion of its debt. Analysts believe the bank wants to capitalize on the recent rise in Encor's stock price, driven by higher crude prices, to maximize the sale value. Dome, which is restructuring over $6 billion in debt, considers Encor a strategic investment and is reluctant to sell. However, the bank's desire to reduce Dome's debt and the potential for other creditors to object to the sale may influence Dome's decision. Additionally, Encor's joint liability in loans to Dome for Beaufort Sea exploration and Dome Mines' guarantee of Dome Petroleum's debt could further complicate any potential sale."

  quoted by the New York Times as saying.

693,"CAROLINA POWER &lt;CPL> CANCELS GENERATING UNIT
  Carolina Power and Light Co said
  its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the
  second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.
      The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about
  one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in
  1992.
      Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under
  review because of a decision by the North Carolina
  Environmental Management Commission that would have required
  the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing
  scrubbers.
      Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation
  since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers
  through the use of low-sulphur coal, and ""The addition of
  scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal
  air quality improvements.""
      The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost
  power from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peaking
  purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with
  scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later
  development of a generating unit.
      Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about
  877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  ""The
  higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would
  increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with

      A company spokesman said the company has already spent
  about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been

  not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina
  Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings
  it will make late this year or early next year.
  

",[41],['earn'],"Carolina Power and Light Co (CPL) has decided to cancel the construction of the coal-fired Mayo Unit Two power plant in North Carolina due to increased costs and stricter air quality regulations. The 690,000 kilowatt unit, which was only 1% complete, would have required expensive sulfur dioxide-removing scrubbers to meet environmental standards. The company will instead purchase power from Duke Power Co at a lower cost. The cancellation costs will be included in rate filings later this year or early next year, but no charge against earnings is expected."
694,"GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM
  The United States' emphasis on its
  foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real
  problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General
  Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.
       By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion
  dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure
  which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual
  report.
      The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal
  budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government
  spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,
  it said.
      GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct
  in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the
  previous two years.
      GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and
  instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current
  account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower
  investment and a smaller federal budget deficit.
      Raising U.S. Trade barriers ""would result in little or no
  reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,
  increase inflation and reduce world trade,"" it said.
      ""The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient
  domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would
  remain,"" the report said.
      GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year
  because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West
  European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a
  low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third
  World debt management and looming protectionism.
      The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of
  Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.
      The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes
  were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.
      ""Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced
  as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not
  borne out last year,"" the report said.
      GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the
  U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly
  expanding money supply and low dollar.
      ""Such a development could worsen the business climate by
  increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in
  turn, would adversely affect world trade.""
      But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the
  United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes
  foreign products more expensive.
      It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human
  and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the
  goods and services sought from abroad.
      World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,
  about half of the rate of the previous year.
      Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,
  continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT
  said.
      Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while
  their imports increased moderately, although full statistics
  are not available yet, GATT said.
      The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations
  were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,
  Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.
  

",[33],['trade'],"The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has warned the United States that its focus on the foreign trade deficit is misplaced, and the real issue lies in the large federal budget deficit. GATT's annual report suggests that the U.S. is fueling protectionist pressure, which could harm the global trading system. The report recommends macroeconomic changes to address the current account payments deficit, rather than raising trade barriers, as this would not significantly reduce the deficit and could lead to increased inflation and reduced world trade. GATT predicts a slower growth in world trade for 1987, due to factors such as slower growth in Japan and West European nations, concerns over third-world debt management, and protectionism. The report also highlights imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany, and the U.S., and warns of a potential increase in U.S. inflation. It notes a surprising rise in U.S. imports despite the dollar's depreciation and suggests that idle resources in the U.S. are not being utilized to produce goods and services sought from abroad. The report also mentions a decline in developing countries' exports and a moderate increase in their imports."

  Japan is sending a three-man team to

  officials warn could spark a wave of anti-U.S. Sentiment here.
      The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergency
  talks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter row
  over trade in computer microchips, officials said.
      ""The sanctions are against the free trade system,"" Ministry
  of International Trade and Industry (MITI) director general
  Noboru Hatakeyama told reporters, adding: ""If these measures are
  taken, the atmosphere in Japan against the United States would
  become not so good as before.""
      Other officials were more blunt. ""The U.S. Action will have
  a significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here),""
  another MITI official said.
      A senior Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be
  identified, told Reuters the U.S. Threats have undercut those
  in the government who argue for conciliation.
      ""There is a very strong argument in Japan that since the
  United States is imposing tariffs unilaterally, why should we
  bother doing anything,"" he said. ""Anything we do, we will be
  bashed.""
      The senior official sounded pessimistic about the
  likelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing U.S.
  Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washington
  on April 29.
      ""I don't think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden
  (by the visit),"" he said.
      Nakasone is widely expected to present a package of
  measures to President Reagan to help contain U.S. Frustration
  over Japan's large trade surplus.
      But the senior official played down those expectations.

  ""one of the finest casinos in the world.""

      Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth
  potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two
  dlrs per share.
      Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon
  resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls
  Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City,
  N.J., casino hotel.
      For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reported

      The company reported second quarter net income of 12.6 mln
  dlrs, or 41 cts per share, compared with income of 7.5 mln
  dlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.
      Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, said
  that although Sosnoff's relatively low bid may attract other
  suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there is
  little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for
  the company.

733,"TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES
  U.S. economic data due out next week is
  unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest
  rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of
  the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.
      ""People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the
  current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve
  doing anything,"" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman
  Mains.
      The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading
  volume, he noted. ""We've had a decline in activity as recent
  economic statistics have not greatly changed people's
  viewpoints on interest rates,"" Mains said.
      The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the
  economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange
  markets after the Paris initiative has made for ""less than
  ebullient market action,"" Mains said.
      He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
  for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the
  top of the trading range.
      ""My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and
  market participants will see that current prices are
  unjustified,"" Mains said.
      Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted
  that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks
  retail interest. ""All of the movement occurs at the opening,""
  afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.
      Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond
  prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward
  revisions in January retail sales and industrial production
  were ""not real exciting,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred
  Leiner.
      ""There is no one factor that will push us through the highs
  at this moment,"" Leiner said.
      Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national
  Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market,
  said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.
  Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the
  direction of bond prices over the next month.
      Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
  around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories
  reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed
  the largest increase since 1979.
      ""The key question will be not whether there is a large
  increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is
  sustainable or a one shot deal,"" Kahan said.
      He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP
  stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on
  second quarter growth.
      If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease
  back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.
  

",[32],['interest'],"The U.S. economic data expected next week is unlikely to significantly impact interest rate futures, which have been trading within a narrow range for the past 3.5 months. Analysts attribute this to a lack of conviction about the economy's strength and the Federal Reserve's actions. The market is showing low trading volume and little momentum, with most activity occurring at the opening. Recent economic data has been mixed, with February producer prices rising slightly and January retail sales and industrial production revised downward. There are no immediate factors that will push bond prices higher, and the upcoming revision to fourth-quarter GNP is not expected to be a market mover. However, first-quarter GNP forecasts could influence bond prices over the next month, with early estimates suggesting around 3% growth due to inventory buildup. The sustainability of this growth will be crucial, as a large increase in the first quarter could lead to a drag on second-quarter growth, potentially slowing the economy."

735,"U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE
  Four U.S. meat processors have asked
  the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which
  they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,
  the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,
  Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow
  mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as
  the species from which it was derived.
      For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients
  statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork.""
      Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product
  would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically
  separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat
  and poultry portion of the product.
      Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost
  product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.
      Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated
  ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry
  product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient
  statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said.
      USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid
  using mechanically separated meat in their products because the
  term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds
  of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar
  regulation exists for poultry products.
      Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass
  parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some
  remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.
  

","[43, 81]","['carcass', 'livestock']","Four US meat processors have requested the federal government to modify a labeling requirement for mechanically separated meat. The companies, including Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp, and Owens Country Sausage, want to list the species from which the meat was derived on product labels instead of the current ""mechanically separated (species)"" requirement.

740,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS
  Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
  economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
  to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
  restrictions two weeks ago.
      Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
  of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
  hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to
  convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.
      But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
  impossible to calculate.
      They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
  economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
      ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
  achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
  contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.
      The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
  Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
  for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
  martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
  originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
  National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
  commission.
      According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
  economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
  trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
  credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
      But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
  booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
  the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,
  which has no real scientific evaluation.""
      A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
  the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
  annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
  imposed.
      Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
  200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
  surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
  against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
      Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
  U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
  chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
  dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland is
  accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
  political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a
  misunderstanding of Western economy.""
      ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
  who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that
  Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
  in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
      Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one
  diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
  and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
  scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
  lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
  on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
  and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
      ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
  be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
  regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
  in play now,"" said one Western envoy.
      He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
  quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
  measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
  Poland's efforts to regain entry.
      Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
  this fact recently.
      Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making
  up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
  difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
  two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
  exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""
      While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
  has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
  imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
  ""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
  of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
  just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
  Solidarity.""
      Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
  talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
  Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
  looking for a lead from the United States.
      He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
  financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short
  time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
  foreign economic partners.""
      He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to
  play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
  interested in the settlement of Polish debt.""
      Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
  Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
  Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
  said it should now play a more positive role.
      ""As a major superpower the United States can influence
  international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings
  aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
  which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.
  

",[33],['trade'],"Poland claims that US sanctions have cost its economy $15 billion, but Western economic experts dispute this figure, arguing that the poor performance of Poland's economy makes it difficult to calculate the exact impact of sanctions. The US imposed the sanctions in 1982 in response to the suppression of the Solidarity free trade union, and Poland now says it has a moral right to assistance from the US. However, Western economists argue that the drying up of credits was due to economic reasons, not political ones, and that Poland's debt and lack of competitiveness will make it difficult to regain access to the US market. Polish officials are seeking a lead from the US in repairing the damage, but Western diplomats and economists remain skeptical, suggesting that Poland's economic problems are largely internal and that the impact of sanctions has been overstated."

742,"DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY
  Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,
  and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan
  takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris
  accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.
      ""The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of
  150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,"" a senior dealer
  at one leading bank said.
      The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at
  around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a
  meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.
      Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,
  but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed
  inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.
  Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.
      Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package
  Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its
  trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would
  probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.
      Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of
  measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost
  domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.
      But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition
  boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition
  of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim
  chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near
  future, the dealers said.
      If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on
  the dollar, they said.
      The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed
  since before the Paris accord, they added.
      ""Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to
  a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt
  crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest
  payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the
  Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms
  scandal,"" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.
      ""There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to
  around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,"" said Chemical Bank
  Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.
      But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way
  for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.
      Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.
  Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for
  quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar
  when it rose to 1.87 marks.
      The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London
  when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.
      But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central
  bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline
  because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying
  intervention as a chance to sell dollars.
      However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch
  assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said ""The dollar will not
  show drastic movement at least to the end of March.""
      Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any
  strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books
  for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar
  would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on
  their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in
  purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.
      U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any

","[83, 51]","['dlr', 'money-fx']","The dollar is expected to decline unless Japan takes action to stimulate its economy and reduce its trade surplus, according to foreign exchange analysts. The dollar is currently stable but could fall below its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen, with some dealers predicting a drop to around 140.00 yen by year-end. However, operators are cautious about pushing the dollar too far due to the possibility of central bank intervention. The U.S. is also hesitant to see any significant dollar movement until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year, as a weak dollar could impact Japanese institutional investors' interest in U.S. Treasury securities."

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng told representatives of several of the largest grain
  exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a
  position to comment on their request that the Reagan
  administration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union,
  according to participants in today's meeting.
      ""He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk
  about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the
  Soviet Union,"" said Glen Hofer, vice president of the National
  Council of Farmer Cooperatives.
      Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to be
  identified, said Lyng was ""unresponsive"" to the group's request.
      Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc,
  Continental Grain Co, Louis Dreyfus Corp, Union Equity
  Cooperative Exchange, the National Association of Wheat
  Growers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, among
  others, participants said.
      Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under
  Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.
      Hofer described Lyng as ""sympathetic but noncommittal,"" and
  said he thought he detected ""a sense of frustration"" on Lyng's
  part at not being able to respond more positively to the
  group's urging.
      A grain industry representative said some participants were
  ""puzzled"" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the
  cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
      ""There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the
  idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,""
  this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring
  to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
      This official said there was not a significant amount of
  pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP
  offer to Moscow.
      Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
  Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an
  offer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone
  calls from lawmakers on the subject.
      But Hofer said other important matters at the White House,
  rather than an absence of political pressure, might have
  restrained Lyng.

  January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.
      ""We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been
  abolished at all,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
      He said the system would be reintroduced after current
  talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund

      Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction
  system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private
  bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.
      Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the
  government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.
      It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and
  strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible
  for the government and the private sector, he said.
      Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The
  kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.
  In January 1987 the government was more than two months in

749,"COASTAL &lt;CGP> SEEKS TO HALT BILLION DLR LAWSUIT
  Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy
  court will hear its request today for a restraining order to
  stop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by &lt;TransAmerican
  Natural Gas Corp>.
      TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy
  proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit
  to block Coastal from taking control.
      Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which
  is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its
  own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.
      Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves
  and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an
  undisclosed amount.
      TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values
  its total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about
  one billion dlrs.
      The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in
  Texas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and
  over 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.
      About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot
  market sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.
      Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay
  its 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. The
  lawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one
  billion in punitive damages from Coastal.
      Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market
  since 1979, when it was forced to sell &lt;Lo-Vaca Gas Gathering
  Co> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas
  customers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.
      Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,
  earned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, about
  half the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices.

758,"HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE
  The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
  &lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
  13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
  share analysts polled by Reuters said.
      Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
  ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
  announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
      They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
  42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
  one-for-five bonus issue.
      Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
  issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
      The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>
  is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
      Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
  than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
  12 pct.
      They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
  for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
      Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
  reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
  Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
  Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
  nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
      ""They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
  as their loan portfolio is well balanced,"" an analyst at Mansion
  House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
      Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
  by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
      Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
  the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
  pct in 1985.
      Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
  on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
  but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
  Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
  system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
      The strength of the real-estate market was another major
  income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
  development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
      ""The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
  business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
  and other foreign banks,"" one analyst said.
      The high level of activity on the capital and equities
  markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
  Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and
  Co>, analysts said. ""Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
  financial adviser and underwriter,"" an analyst said.
      Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
  flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
  Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
      The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
  for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
  in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
  English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
      The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
  not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
      Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
  need to write off bad debts. ""The need for provisions was much
  lower than the year before,"" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
  Securities Co Ltd. ""Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
  2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.""
      Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
  bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
  shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
  Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
  forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
      The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
  51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have
  improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
  fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
  from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
  mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.
  

",[41],['earn'],"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp (HKBH.HK) is expected to report a 10-13% increase in profit for 1986, primarily due to stronger loan growth, a robust Hong Kong economy, and a thriving real estate market. Analysts predict net earnings to range from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs, with a final dividend of 29 cents, totaling 42 cents for the year. The bank's subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank Ltd (HSGH.HK), is also expected to announce a net profit of over one billion dlrs for the first time. The bank's performance was boosted by increased loan demand, particularly in the trade and property sectors, as well as low-interest rates and a strong capital market. Additionally, the bank's reduced need to write off bad debts and improved Latin American exposure through its subsidiary, Marine Midland Banks Inc, have contributed to its positive financial outlook."

      Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was

      Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct

  Federal Reserve Board Governor
  Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
  permitting formation of financial services holding companies
  involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
  securities.
      In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
  and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, ""I believe
  that increased diversification along geographic and product
  lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.""
      He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
  companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
  Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
  insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
  would be handled on functional lines.
      ""Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
  bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
  have to be on an arms-length basis,"" Heller said.
      Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
  special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
      Heller said he ""would require the holding company to serve
  as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
  maintain the bank's capital.
      ""In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
  long as the holding company has a positive net worth.""
      Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
  to own a financial services holding company, again with the
  provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
  if necessary.
      Heller said the effects of these actions ""would be banks
  that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them"" in
  which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
  ""loot the bank"" was removed.
      Such diversification would give access to national and
  international financial services to corporations across the
  United States.
      Heller said that would mean ""the steady decline of America's
  banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested"" by
  permitting them to become more competitive.

772,"AUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS
  Domestic demand is now expected to make
  no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal
  1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all
  of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.
      However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic
  Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise
  in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.
      But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this
  financial year and net export growth will provide the total
  source of gdp growth.
      The August budget had forecast domestic demand would
  contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5
  pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.
      Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic
  parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a
  slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit
  than first anticipated.
      ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit
  for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that
  the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said.
      Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC
  in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is
  broadly on track, Keating said.
      ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more
  sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said.
      ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more
  than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth
  in domestic production and employment.""
      Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation
  rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.
      ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in
  inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary
  effects wane,"" he said.
      Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick
  up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in
  net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from
  private domestic demand.
      He said domestic demand growth will be due to a
  strengthening in real household disposable income.
      The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year
  should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level
  broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.
      ""The current account deficit will continue to show
  improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said.
      ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent
  years recede further, and given continued effective wage
  restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he
  said.
  

","[42, 34]","['bop', 'gnp']","Treasurer Paul Keating announced changes to Australia's economic forecasts, stating that domestic demand is expected to make no contribution to economic growth in the 1986/87 fiscal year, while net exports will account for the overall increase. The forecast GDP rise of 2.25% has not been revised, but domestic demand may slightly decline, with net export growth driving GDP growth. The budget strategy is on track, with domestic demand slightly lower than expected and net exports expanding more than anticipated. The current account deficit is expected to be lower than initially forecast, and inflation is likely to exceed the budget forecast of 8% for 1986/87.

774,"LAWSON WANTS STERLING AROUND 1.60 DLRS, 2.90 MKS
  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was,
  specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
      He told the National Economic Development Council that the
  recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed
  on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a
  ""reasonable alignment of currencies"" and the U.K. Government
  intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said.
      That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most
  important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said.
      His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was
  highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.
      In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the
  Government's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign
  exchange markets set limits to test.
      Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of
  government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept
  near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and
  intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
      The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and
  2.9210/45 marks.

780,"JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT
  Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to
  salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -
  sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its
  case and instructing its producers to cut output further.
      ""We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,""
  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy
  Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.
      ""If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will
  create very serious problems.""
      The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to
  meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral
  agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed
  to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to
  increase its imports of American semiconductors.
      Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by
  selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost
  American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory
  action.
      In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese
  chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost
  domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.
      Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit
  dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only
  memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a
  cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the
  year.
      He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of
  chips available for export through unregulated distributors in
  the so-called grey market.
      ""We have almost no grey market,"" he said. ""Supply is
  diminishing.""
      To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI
  called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,
  NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing
  specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary
  of &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>.
      Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the
  steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for
  U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.
      The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George
  Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
      The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are
  expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker
  Micron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in
  Hong Kong.
      Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong
  Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but
  denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.
      ""If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We
  will present our rebuttal,"" he said.
      The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's
  advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above
  production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.
      He also called the case ""strange,"" but he stopped short of
  endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been
  trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron
  publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day
  they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who
  had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

  Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald
  Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
  continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
  or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
      Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
  billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
  remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
  spending will be internally financed.
      Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
  regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
  Bell operating company.
      In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
  Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
  revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
  commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
      The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
  rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
  180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
  and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
  modernization costs.
      Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
  to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
  transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
      ""We have not agreed to anything,"" Guinn said, but added he
  would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
  company would make a decision soon on participating.
      Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
  U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
  companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
  the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
      ""(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
  It's a commodity business and becoming more so,"" he said. ""I'm
  not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
  business.""
      However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
  recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
  Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
  businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
  alliances with other companies.
      He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
  new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
  talks. ""We do not have anything actively under consideration,""
  he said.
  

",[41],['earn'],"Pacific Telesis Group's chairman, Donald Guinn, anticipates continued earnings growth in 1987, surpassing the previous year's earnings of $1.08 billion or $5.02 per share. Capital expenditure is expected to remain steady at $1.8 billion annually through 1989, with all funding coming from internal sources. The company faces regulatory challenges in rate cases for its Pacific Bell subsidiary, potentially impacting revenue by $76 million or more. A requested rate hike of $225 million is under scrutiny, with $180 million questioned and $45 million deemed unnecessary for modernization. Guinn also mentioned the possibility of joining a transpacific cable project but stated no decision has been made. Regarding the US Department of Justice's recommendation on limited long-distance services, Guinn expressed disinterest, citing the competitive nature of the business, while welcoming the flexibility it offers for non-regulated ventures and strategic alliances."

788,"FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT
  The government announced a three billion
  franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation
  among political and economic analysts that it is positioning
  itself for a period of economic reflation.
      The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister
  Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe
  Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc
  contingency fund announced on February 25.
      Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a
  reflationary program.
      Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for
  more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third
  of French unemployed, government figures show.
      The main measures of the employment program give employers
  financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at
  least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term
  unemployed return to the labour market.
      Training subsidies and exemptions from social security
  contributions are the main incentives for employers.
      ""Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong
  incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour
  market and that's why the proposals...Are costly,"" an aide to
  Seguin said.
      The analysts said speculation the government is considering
  a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis
  Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally
  agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.
      He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out
  economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its
  1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.
      Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's
  remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate
  the economy through a boost to consumer spending although
  government policy allowed for increased industrial investment
  from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.
      The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue
  from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt
  and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.
      Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly
  reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on
  social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.
       Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of
  strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and
  drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with
  labour.
       Officials said that after the success of the privatisation
  of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas
  &lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year
  privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it
  this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in
  1988.
      The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted
  revenue to boost industrial and research investment and
  spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway
  network.
     The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last
  year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage
  more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by
  improving the competitiveness of French industry.
      The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and
  variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put
  to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed
  for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of
  State.
  

",[31],['jobs'],"The French government has announced a 3 billion franc program to tackle long-term unemployment, with measures including financial incentives for employers to offer short-term contracts and retraining for the unemployed. This announcement comes amid speculation of a potential reflationary program, despite previous denials by the Finance Minister. The employment plan will be funded from a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund, and aims to reduce the number of long-term unemployed, which currently stands at about 830,000. The government also plans to speed up its privatization program to generate additional revenue for industrial and research investment, and has revived a proposal for more flexible working hours to boost job creation. These moves come ahead of the 1988 presidential elections and follow a wave of strikes in December that led to a more conciliatory approach with labor unions."

793,"JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE
  The Japanese government appears to have
  little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over
  computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.
      The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
  mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the
  microchip trade signed last September.
      A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters ""Japan has done
  what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait
  for those steps to take effect.""
      The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September
  agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
  non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.
  Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.
       Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut
  production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
  third countries at non-regulated prices.
      ""I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,"" said
  Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.
      A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
  for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it
  would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.
      Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
  would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita
  Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
  imports was not likely.
      Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
  the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be
  levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
  microchips themselves.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,
  there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,""
  said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.
      ""The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
  stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be
  delayed for another year,"" he said.
      Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by
  stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
  for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.
      ""The American approach is full of contradictions,"" Jardine
  Fleming's Edwards said.
      ""If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they
  want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
  hurts the final market,"" Edwards said.
      But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.
  Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also
  frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts
  argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
  to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.
      Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,
  said ""The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
  economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.""
  

",[33],['trade'],"Japan is struggling to settle a dispute with the U.S. over computer chip trade, with the U.S. threatening to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics exports. The U.S. claims that Japan is selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. markets and not opening up their market to U.S. chip sales, despite a previous agreement. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has ordered chipmakers to cut production to address the issue, but analysts suggest that more action may be needed. The potential tariffs would significantly impact Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., and some argue that Japan needs to stimulate its domestic economy and reduce its reliance on exports. The dispute reflects U.S. concerns about the strategic semiconductor industry and Japan's large trade surplus, indicating that further measures may be required to resolve the issue."

  Britain has reaped profits by using a
  stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last
  autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor
  of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
      He said in a parliamentary debate, ""I can now tell the House
  (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves
  in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been
  repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.""
      Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures
  then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said.
  The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one
  point.
      During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson
  unveiled last week, he said that ""during the period of foreign
  exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat
  inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the
  end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene
  unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would
  enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather
  than the two pct the market was then pressing for.""
      He said that that one percentage point increase, effected
  in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half
  point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10
  pct.
      Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British
  reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England
  intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the
  authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and
  October 1986, government sources said.

This profit was made possible by the government's intervention in the currency market during a crisis in September and October 1986.

The government's intervention involved selling around 1.0 billion dollars from reserves to support the pound, and the subsequent repurchase of these dollars resulted in a profit of tens of millions of pounds. This strategy not only helped stabilize the currency but also allowed for a more moderate interest rate adjustment."

  Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
  insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
  fines and disbarment from the securities industry.

  inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
  and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
  through to legitimate investors and traders,"" Shad said in his

  less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
  increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
  five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.

  the tender offer process needed reform including earlier
  disclosure of takeover attempts.

  Brazil wants to increase its
  steel exports to the United States, now limited because of
  tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan
  administration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute
  (IBS) said.
      Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a
  three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.
      In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations,
  the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting
  nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa
  and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United
  States by about 30 pct in 1985.
      The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's
  steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,
  increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in
  1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.
      Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil's export
  share of non-flat products to the U.S. Market.

  Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast
  earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs
  821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained
  at their present parities.
      Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
  crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
      A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
  negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
  on currency movements.
      Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
  writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
      The company said mainly this represented the premium the
  group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
  had taken over.
      The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
  billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
  by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
  partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
      Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
  having used more funds than generated by group operations,

  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with
  the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.
      At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and
  Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm
  U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices
  in semiconductors.
      Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled
  meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council
  to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact
  with the U.S.
      That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,
  calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets
  and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.
      Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live
  up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.
      Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the
  pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out
  Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.
      In his letter, the contents of which were released today,
  Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March
  showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices
  in Asian markets.
      In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI
  vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested
  the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into
  allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

842,"BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC
  Brazil has no set target for
  its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of
  International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas,
  President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster
  said.
      He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its
  export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it
  had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as
  the country's export target to ICO-member countries.
      The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an
  agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.
      It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of
  an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be
  above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.
      Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and
  market analysts before taking any decision on export policy,
  but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market
  conditions.
      ""We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause
  markets to panic,"" Dauster added.
      He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee
  to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.
      ""Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does
  not need an ICO agreement as a crutch,"" Dauster said.
      Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said
  consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two
  mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.
      ""It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss
  for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to
  recover,"" he said.
      The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving
  average of exportable production surpluses would lead to
  overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher
  quotas, he said.
      Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility
  had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its
  stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.
      Close links would continue with these producers,
  particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African
  countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was
  envisaged at present.
      He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a
  system of roaster buying contracts, although ""no hypothesis has
  been abandoned.""
      Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for
  May shipment coffee will be opened.
      He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy
  of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as
  some exporters had suggested.
      He noted export registrations for the first four months of
  the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9
  mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between
  11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.
      He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln
  bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate
  until late April.

Jorio Dauster, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, stated that they will not make any short-term decisions that could panic the market and will instead adopt a flexible policy adjusted to market conditions. Dauster mentioned that the consumer proposals would have resulted in significant losses for Brazil, and he rejected claims that Brazil's inflexibility caused the talks to break down. He also noted that Brazil currently has no plans to return to roaster buying contracts and has not decided on the opening of registrations for May shipment coffee."

"
849,"HOG REPORT SHOWS MORE HOGS ON FARMS
  The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report
  yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year
  as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged
  producers to step up production, analysts said.
      Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile
  Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as
  bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply
  lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in
  nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.
      University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,""The
  report shows that hog producers have responded to a very
  desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10
  months.""
      Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures
  prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures
  fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still
  lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy
  selling pressure today.
      ""We have not had a period of profitability of this
  magnitude since last summer,"" Levitt said. ""In fact, hog
  operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been
  so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back
  on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog
  operation alone.""
      Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was
  negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the
  slaughter increased from the previous year.
      We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we
  didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state
  spring report, Levitt added.
      High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that
  could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased
  profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to
  increase production starting late last year.
      Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog
  herd resulted from a revision of the December report and
  without the revision, the March report might have been very
  close to average expectations.
      Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major
  upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding
  herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more
  bearish than initially indicated.
      But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report
  to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant
  contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because
  traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.
      Discounts in the October and December contracts take into
  consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May
  farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1
  report, Fuller said.
      Grimes said, ""As far as the distant months are concerned,
  if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60
  lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a
  tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us
  to push down to the prices that the current futures show for
  the July and August period.""
      Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that
  distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than
  they were last summer.
      ""If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs
  during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper
  this year because we have six pct more numbers,"" he said.
  

","[81, 87]","['livestock', 'hog']","The USDA's quarterly hogs and pigs report indicates an increase in the number of hogs on U.S. farms compared to the previous year. This rise in hog production is attributed to the profitability of low grain prices, which encouraged farmers to expand their operations. Analysts and traders anticipate that the report will negatively impact pork futures, with prices potentially opening lower. The report's weight breakdown and revisions from the previous report also contribute to the bearish sentiment. However, distant futures contracts have already factored in expected increases in farrowing intentions, and analysts suggest that further price discounts may not be necessary. The high hog-corn ratio and resulting profits have played a significant role in the expansion of hog production, but analysts also note that the breeding herd size revision in the December report made it more bearish than initially thought."

  Finance and economy ministers of the

  after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at
  boosting economic integration.
      But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
  Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a
  resolution on a common currency exchange rate system.
      The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed
  Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that
  the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank
  governors for further discussion.
      He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed
  denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were
  asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance
  ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.
      Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to

  conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.

865,"U.S. TREASURY PROPOSES SOME S. AFRICAN IMPORTS
  The Treasury proposed allowing 
  temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
  oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
  clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last
  fall.
      The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next
  week requests written congressional and public comment within
  60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported
  for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.
      The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary
  imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it
  passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
  -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
      ""The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal
  government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in
  a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on
  uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for
  processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the
  act,"" the Treasury brief said.
      The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and
  oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
  South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
  the Soviet Union for processing.
      Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African
  ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export
  ""provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a
  license for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory
  Commission.""
      The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods
  to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled
  organizations for repair or servicing in the United States.
      ""The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made
  under bond,"" the brief said.
      The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United
  States to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation
  practiced by South Africa's white minority government,
  prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel,
  coal and textiles at the end of 1986.
  

",[84],['strategic-metal'],"The US Treasury is proposing to allow temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium oxide until July 1st, under specific conditions, while they clarify anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress. This proposal, which will be published in the Federal Register, seeks to protect US industry and prevent potential harm to the domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal government's enrichment industry. The Treasury believes that an outright ban on these imports could inadvertently hurt US interests and potentially benefit foreign competitors, such as the Soviet Union. The proposal also suggests allowing temporary imports of US-origin goods from South African state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing in the US. These measures aim to balance the enforcement of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid policies with the need to protect American economic interests."

"
869,"MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT
  The new International Natural Rubber
  Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock
  as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding
  export quotas or production controls.
      The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under
  the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
  Development (UNCTAD).
      In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble
  those contained in the present one.
      The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore
  cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and
  October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the
  daily market indicator price remains above the upper
  intervention (""may sell"") price (231 cts) or below the lower
  intervention (""may buy"") price (171 cts) for six months.
      If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely
  considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts
  -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five
  pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber
  Council decides.
      The new reference price would then be taken over for the
  new agreement.
      Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference
  price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the
  Council decides on a higher percentage.
      Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to
  300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the
  reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless
  the Council decides on a higher percentage.
      Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price
  reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.
      Those changes are intended to make the reference price more
  responsive to market trends.
      As in the present accord the ""may buy"" and ""may sell"" levels
  are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the
  ""must buy"" and ""must sell"" levels at 20 pct of it.
      The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling
  prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the
  Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.
      During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal
  that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,
  currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.
      The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the
  same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision
  for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.
      Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be
  brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.
      At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for
  producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact
  had served the purpose for which it had been created.
      Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers,
  agreed that the current agreement had worked ""relatively well.""
      Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA,
  delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord
  had maintained the average price above the ""must buy"" level.
      They said the agreement until now did not appear to have
  encouraged excessive production of rubber.
      In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer
  stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. ""It is a
  sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,"" one delegate said.
      The new pact will be open for signature at U.N.
  Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.
      To become operational, it will require ratification by
  countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of
  world imports.
      Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from
  now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the
  International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.
      The pact will enter into force definitively when
  governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct
  of world imports have ratified it.
  

",[28],['rubber'],"The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) maintains the use of a buffer stock as the primary tool for market intervention, excluding export quotas or production controls. The new agreement, adopted under the UNCTAD, closely resembles the current 1979 pact in many aspects.

The new INRA introduces changes to make the reference price more responsive, including automatic revisions and shorter review intervals. The maximum buffer stock remains at 400,000 tonnes with an additional 150,000 tonnes for contingency. The new pact has been generally well-received, with delegates noting its success in maintaining prices and managing production. The agreement will be open for signature at the UN Headquarters in New York, requiring ratification from countries representing a significant portion of world exports and imports to become operational."

  The European Community (EC) yesterday
  warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,
  that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations
  with both countries.
      EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's
  continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make
  a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they
  were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that
  would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were
  prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already
  distanced itself from the bill.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written
  to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
  outlining the EC's concerns.
      The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.
  Moves towards protectionism. ""The adoption of such measures
  would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of
  multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral
  relations,"" it said.
      Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but
  to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade, it said.
      In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said
  they ""deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in
  trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.""
      The statement said the EC would continue to insist that
  Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.
      Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a
  report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them
  to take appropriate action where necessary.
      One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers
  were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. ""It will
  be back on the table again and again,"" the diplomat said.
      De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,
  ""There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the
  Community concerning trade relations with Japan.""
      But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo
  to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and
  damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more
  cooperation with Japan in industry and research.
  

",[33],['trade'],"The European Community (EC) has issued a warning to the United States and Japan, expressing concern over trade tensions and their impact on EC relations with both countries.

EC Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq communicated these concerns to US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. The EC statement highlighted the negative consequences of US protectionist measures on multilateral negotiations and bilateral relations, leaving the EC with no choice but to respond within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Separately, the EC ministers urged Japan to address the trade imbalance by increasing imports and stimulating domestic demand. They also requested a report on US-Japanese trade by July to facilitate necessary actions. The EC is committed to resolving the issue through negotiations with Tokyo rather than engaging in a trade war, and they advocate for enhanced cooperation with Japan in industry and research."

      The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday
  that Baldrige has ""serious concerns"" about the sale of Fairchild
  Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics

  could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign
  /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its
  advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence
  gathering.
      In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the
  already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan
  stemming from the huge Japanese surplus.

  sale in the coming weeks, they said.

  of high technology to foreign governments and companies.

  could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign

  advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence

      In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the

  stemming from the huge Japanese surplus.
      The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the

873,"U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER
  Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
  weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns
  in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,
  analysts and traders said.
      They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln
  barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3
  and four mln barrels.
      Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six
  mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5
  mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from
  the previous week or slightly higher or lower.
      For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks
  fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for
  the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between
  700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance
  gasoline stocks will be unchanged.
      API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the
  week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a
  similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock
  levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.
      The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal
  factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.
      Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended
  March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between
  3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended
  March 27.
      API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up
  three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said
  utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by
  less than one pct for the week ended March 27.
      Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market
  slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already
  partially reflected in today's gains, they added.

875,"NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
  visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.
  Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said
  they believed his chances of success were slim.
      Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and
  widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be
  hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.
  President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.
      News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided
  with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus
  last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.
      It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's
  Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action
  against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint
  trade agreement on computer microchips.
      Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one
  designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the
  short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium
  term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.
      But government officials said political infighting could
  rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent
  one from seeing the light of day.
      Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up
  a package of short-term economic measures until after its
  1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would
  amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.
      But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for
  his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by
  opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.
      Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the
  U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling
  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own
  measures.
      He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis
  of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament
  over the budget, political analysts said.
      Officials working on the government's short-term economic
  package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on
  loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to
  pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in
  the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.
      They said a record portion of state investment planned for
  the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first
  half, probably over 80 pct.
      Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy
  Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.
  Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade
  deficit.
      To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also
  likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term
  economic plans.
      A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan
  governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final
  report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days
  before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.
      Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to
  Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are
  likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as
  agricultural reform and land policy, officials said.
      While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed
  as possible, they said the political realities might force them
  to water down some of the committee's recommendations.
      A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy
  might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes
  massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee
  projects that the current account surplus will fall to less
  than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national
  product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which
  measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct
  of gnp.
      The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for
  Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual
  appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around
  1993, from 150 now.
  

",[33],['trade'],"Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington in April to address growing US concerns about Japan's trade policies, but his efforts may be hindered by domestic political pressures and opposition to his tax reform plans. Nakasone aims to present two packages to the US, one for short-term economic measures and another for long-term economic restructuring, but political infighting may weaken the impact of these proposals. The short-term package may include interest rate cuts, deregulation, consumer price reductions, and increased public investment. However, these measures may not satisfy the US, which is seeking to reduce its trade deficit. Nakasone's visit comes as Japan's trade surplus has increased significantly, and the US has decided to take retaliatory action over a trade agreement on computer microchips. The success of Nakasone's visit is uncertain, and he may face challenges in offering meaningful concessions to the US while also navigating domestic political constraints."

  OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of
  oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its
  ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and
  Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.
      A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through
  Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have
  shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador
  has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.
      MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first
  week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to
  output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
      MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of
  its total production into floating storage.
      Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the
  television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,
  including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.
      The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan
  oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with
  its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower
  than that.
      It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially
  stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March
  because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still
  lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a
  further 25,000 bpd of ""purchase crude.""
      It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only
  2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift
  at official prices.
      MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member
  countries calling for the formation of a committee to study
  what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among
  various members.
      The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was
  having difficulty selling crude at official prices.
      The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries
  export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC
  price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude
  on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and
  ""other forms of hydrocarbons"" which are marketed in package deals
  with crude oil.
  

",[86],['crude'],"The Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimates that OPEC's oil production in the second week of March was around 14 million barrels per day, significantly lower than its ceiling of 15.8 million bpd, due to pipeline issues in Turkey and Ecuador.

Saudi Arabia's oil output was reported to be around 3 million bpd, with some of it going into floating storage. Libya's oil production is lower than its quota, and they are having difficulties selling crude at official prices, according to MEES.

894,"AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES
  The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB)
  1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes
  already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.
      ""We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export
  target for the year,"" he said in a statement.
      He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB
  spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the
  Soviet Union and Iraq.
      In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB
  exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.
      Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has
  ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered
  to the AWB.
      The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of
  receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.
      However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was
  still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat
  may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final
  Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.
      Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February
  Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.
      But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could
  turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the
  final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes.
  The official estimate is not yet available.
      In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of
  the 16.13 mln tonne crop.
      Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000
  sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow
  farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's
  receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics
  data.
  

","[19, 39]","['wheat', 'grain']","The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) is making progress in its 1986/87 export program, having already sold over 10 million tonnes of wheat. The AWB is on track to meet its 15 million tonne export target for the year, with sales to various countries including Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union, and Iraq. The 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has concluded with 15.14 million tonnes delivered to the AWB, and the crop is expected to be around 16.2 million tonnes, although the official estimate is not yet available. The AWB received almost the entire crop in the previous season, with a small portion retained on farms or sold under a permit system."

  1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.

  marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding
  exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and
  incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.
      Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this
  year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group
  1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.
      Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to
  394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same
  period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.
      Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13
  to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks
  nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum
  issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital
  currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.

  necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for
  acquisitions. He declined to give further details.
      While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion
  marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91
  billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of
  the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming
  orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.
      World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4
  pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to
  739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.

901,"CHRYSLER &lt;C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS
  Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to
  takeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster the
  small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000
  employees in doubt, industry analysts say.
      It was ""business as usual"" yesterday at the American Motors
  headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by
  Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company
  spokesman Edd Snyder.
      But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,
  would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if
  it had continued with the state-run French car group as its
  controlling shareholder.
      Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly
  plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would
  be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American
  auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.
      Both plants are far from ""state of the art"" for car
  manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor
  relations at each.
      ""Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants,"" said Michael
  Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson
  Lehman Brothers. ""They probably will close the Toledo plant and
  move Jeep production to Canada.""
      Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the
  very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to
  wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union
  local representing Jeep workers.
      ""The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they
  have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have
  underutilized facilities to transfer production,"" he said.
      Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that
  would abort a combination which historians said would be the
  auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed
  in 1954.
      AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses
  of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France
  for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could
  not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the
  earliest.
      In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee
  Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln
  dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of
  1,200 dealers as the major attractions.
      Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually
  to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead
  costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur
  in the AMC buyout.

The deal, valued at $1.5 billion, was announced by Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, and will be discussed at an AMC board meeting. Industry analysts predict that AMC's car assembly plants in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and Toledo, Ohio, may face closure due to overcapacity in the North American auto industry and AMC's history of poor labor relations. Analysts believe that Chrysler might sell or close older plants to reduce costs, and they foresee no major obstacles to the merger, which is considered the auto industry's biggest since 1954. AMC's Jeep division, a new assembly plant in Ontario, and its dealer network were cited as key attractions for Chrysler."

907,"JAPAN BEEF PRICE SUPPORT CUT WILL NOT RAISE DEMAND
  Japan's plan to cut beef intervention
  prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost
  demand because of strict supply controls and a complex
  distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.
      ""Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting
  consumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,"" a
  Housewives Association of Japan official said.
      Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm
  markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which
  maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.
      Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the
  standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled
  beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against
  1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.
      The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from
  dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling
  at 1,325 against 1,420.
      Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock
  Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations
  to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention
  price zone.
      The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount
  set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale
  prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,
  both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when
  prices are below.
      But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef
  stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.
      Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export
  Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step
  toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about
  half those in Japan.
      But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.
  Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated
  distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.
      The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices
  are high mainly because of distribution problems and high
  production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.
      American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.
  Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan
  Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in
  the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

  the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.
      But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand
  will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp
  reduction in intervention prices.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he
  will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he
  visits here next month.
      In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by
  9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.
      In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from
  168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants
  to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.
  

","[43, 81]","['carcass', 'livestock']","Japan is planning to reduce beef intervention prices for the upcoming fiscal year, but this move is unlikely to boost demand due to strict supply controls and a complex distribution system. The price reduction aims to protect farmers and narrow the price gap with European Community prices, but it may not significantly impact consumers or US meat exporters. Retail beef prices in Japan are high due to distribution issues, high production costs, and the operations of the Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC). American meat packers view Japan as a potential market, but the distribution system and supply control by the LIPC could limit demand even if retail prices drop. The US Agriculture Secretary will request the removal of beef import restrictions during an upcoming visit to Japan, where the beef import quota has been gradually increasing."

912,"IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED
  Ivory Coast today predicted that the
  present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the
  recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in
  London would not last long.
      Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer
  nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an
  oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis
  Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be
  obliged to restore their positions.
      ""I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April,"" he
  told a news conference here at his return from the failed
  London talks.
      Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in
  London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the
  lowest since 1982.
      Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs
  (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by
  Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the
  slide on the world markets continues.
      He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa
  producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an
  African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of
  next month.
      Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based
  Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of
  the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.
      ""An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,"" he said
  without elaborating.
      ""Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked
  on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile
  market,"" he said.
      Questioned by journalists, the minister said President
  Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his
  government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed
  by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.
      Last year, the West African nation announced that the
  coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)
  per kilo.
      Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify
  its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from
  world market fluctuation.
      A communique read over the state-run television tonight
  said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran
  Ivorian leader reaffirmed ""his faith in Ivory Coast's bright
  (economic) future"" despite the commodities price slide.
      The Agriculture Minister also announced the government
  decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln
  dlrs) to support the country's small farmers.
      Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of
  Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times
  following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and
  coffee.
      Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to
  grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986,
  according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.
  

",[35],['coffee'],"The Ivory Coast's agriculture minister, Denis Bra Kanon, predicts that the recent coffee price crash will be short-lived and expects the market to recover by April. This comes after producer and consumer nations failed to agree on new export quotas to address the oversupply in the coffee market. The price of robusta coffee beans for May delivery has fallen to its lowest since 1982, with Ivory Coast estimating significant revenue losses if the market slide continues. The country, a major cocoa and coffee producer, plans to lead an African initiative to reach a compromise by the end of next month. The government has also allocated funds to support small farmers and maintains the price guaranteed to coffee growers. However, the sharp slump in coffee and cocoa prices has impacted Ivory Coast's economy, with a significant slowdown in GDP growth expected this year compared to 1986."

"
915,"OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT
  Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
  over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
  effort to support prices, analysts said.
      ""The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
  hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
  another meeting,"" said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      ""But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
  seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added.
      Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
  to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
  the official prices agreed to last december.
      The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
  Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
  of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
  Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
      The Saudis have also offered to support members having
  difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
      ""They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
  prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
  member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
  that lose sales,"" Margoshes said.
      He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
  of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
      Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
  nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
  is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
  Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
      Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
  president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
  meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
  December pact is falling apart.
      Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
  Harris and Co said, ""both physical and futures markets have been
  oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
  covering rally.""
      He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
  refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
  into the market to cover their short positions.
      Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
  to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
  sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
  yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
  North sea crude oil market.
      Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
  that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
  for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
  being fixed to make such shipments.
      North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
  reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
      OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
  quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
      Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
  production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
  december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
  claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
      ""The production probably is about their quota level and
  largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
  its oil as a result,"" Margoshes said.
      Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
  current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
  Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
      But others said that despite the rally today there were
  still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
  could cut the rally short.
      Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
  slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
  demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
  about 1.4 pct over 1986.
  

",[86],['crude'],"Oil prices have increased due to Saudi Arabia's efforts to support prices and prevent other OPEC members from discounting oil. The Saudis are working to maintain the official prices agreed upon in December and have offered to support members facing difficulties in selling their oil. This has caused oil prices to rally, with crude oil trading over $17 per barrel and North Sea Brent exceeding $17. OPEC members are denying overproduction, and analysts have varying opinions on the sustainability of the price increase. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC maintain their stance, while others point to factors like demand that could limit the rally."

  Trans World Airlines said it has
  proposed a cash merger of USAir Group with TWA in which the
  holders of USAir common would receive 52 dlrs in cash in
  exchange for their stock.
      TWA said the offer was made in a letter to Edmin Colodny,

  acceptable it may make an offer directly to USAir's

  be purchased in a voting trust at a price lower than today's
  offer.

  application for approval, on an expedited basis, of its

928,"JAPAN SAYS OECD STUDY ON SUBSIDIES STILL ONGOING
  Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials
  said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way
  and will be completed sometime next month.
      The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,
  and they said Japan would comment on the final results.
      A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study
  has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in
  the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other
  commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been
  officially released due to objections from some countries.
      Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the
  release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.
  OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting
  in mid-May.
      One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was
  based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped
  sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,
  and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.
      ""The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does
  not take account of various differences in farming conditions
  in each country, such as geography,"" the source said.
      He said it is highly likely that the final study will show
  Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.
      ""This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm
  market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's
  agriculture policy,"" he said, without giving further details.
      A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies
  by major exporting nations like the United States and the
  European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.

Despite objections from some countries, Japan has agreed to the study's release, which is expected to be approved by OECD directors in mid-May. Japanese subsidies have decreased significantly since the study period due to budgetary constraints and currency fluctuations. The ministry source criticized the study for not considering differences in farming conditions across countries and predicted that Japan will be shown to have the highest farm subsidies. This could lead to increased pressure to open Japan's farm market, but the source did not elaborate on the potential impact on Japan's agriculture policy. The study aims to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations, but Japan is primarily an importer."

931,"U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES
  From April through December 1986,
  the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs
  worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not
  been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in
  certificates has been authorized for issuance during
  January-August, 1987.
      These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
  and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department
  said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
      Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain
  more competitive on world markets, it said.
      The department said last summer, for example, certificates
  were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped
  increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices
  averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they
  would have otherwise.
      The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
  to 50 mln bushels, it said.
      The department said government spending on farm programs in
  fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
  1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
      During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half
  of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,
  annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
  year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.
      The department said the President's budget proposals for
  1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
  billion dlrs.
      In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain
  close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct
  average of 1980-86, it said.
      Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume
  is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
  years, the department said.
  

","[64, 19, 39]","['corn', 'wheat', 'grain']","The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued generic certificates worth billions of dollars from April 1986 to August 1987, with a significant portion remaining unexchanged. These certificates aim to provide free corn and wheat supplies, making U.S. grain more competitive globally. The release of stocks through certificates helped lower farm-level corn prices, increasing usage. Government spending on farm programs is projected to decrease in the coming years, with a significant reduction of $8 billion by 1992 if current policies are maintained. The President's budget proposals for 1988-1992 aim to further cut farm program spending by $24 billion. In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain stable, leading to an expected rise in U.S. export volume for the first time in seven years."

936,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT
  A year after squeezing to power with a
  narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
  Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
  choking the French economy.
      But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
  recovery the government says will follow from its free market
  policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
  so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
  and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
  in 1986, is uncertain.
      Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
  target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
  Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
  some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
  miracle may be running out.
      The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
  elections due by April next year.
      France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
  right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
  reviews from non-partisan analysts.
      For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
  newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
  achievement has been to launch ""a veritable intellectual
  revolution"" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
  state control.
      ""The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
  but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
  excellent,"" Develle said.
      But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
  architect of the government's free market policies, may be
  pursuing a mirage.
      ""The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
  explosion of economic forces is ideological"" said Indosuez chief
  economist Jean Cheval. ""Personally I think it's an illusion.
  Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
  from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible.""
      Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
  Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
  have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
  pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
  popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
  and industries to private investors.
      Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
  bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glass
  maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two state
  companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
  franc five-year privatisation plan.
      Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
  capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
  flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
  the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
  December.
      At the end of last year the government abolished price
  controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
  repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
  businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
      The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
  in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
  official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
  less.
      ""But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
  consider that prices are now free for the first time since
  1945,"" commented Develle of Paribas.
      Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
  foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
  billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
  down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
      But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
  gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
  franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
  three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
  since Chirac took power.
      A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
  failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
  wanted.
      Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
  sectors, French industrial goods were ""increasingly ill-adapted
  to demand"" and over-priced, the report said.
      French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
  with the report. ""One of the assumptions of the government is
  that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
  modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
  freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,"" he said.
      And despite rising industrial investment and the
  introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
  the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
  million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
      The problem for the government is that there may be little
  more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
      French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
  last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
  shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
  West Germany and Japan, they say.
   REUTER...
  

",[9],['cpi'],"The French government, led by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, has implemented a series of free market policies to stimulate the economy, including deregulation, privatization, and the easing of labor regulations. While company profits and the stock market have risen, unemployment remains high, and growth is stagnant at around 2% annually. The government has achieved a reduction in state debt and budget deficit, but the French franc was recently devalued against the West German mark. The government's policies have received mixed reviews, with some analysts praising the intellectual revolution they have sparked, while others argue that the belief in economic liberalism is an illusion and that more direction is needed. The French economy faces challenges in industrial productivity and competitiveness, and the government may have limited options to accelerate growth."

941,"USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORN-U.S. REPORT
  The Soviet Union has been a heavy
  buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5
  mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report
  from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.
      Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already
  been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this
  sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association
  reported to the U.S. official.
      In a report dated March 10, the official said that about
  800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance
  of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.
      An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from
  July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav
  corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.
      Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav
  corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for
  exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.
      Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged
  around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier
  estimates of 150,000, the official said.
      The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav
  corn sales during this marketing year, he said.

  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
  agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
      Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
  economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
  fundamentals.
      Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
  bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
  agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
  to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
  necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
  likely.
      But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
  levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
  fundamentals.
      In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
  currencies around their then current levels.
      Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
  the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
  yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
  nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
  surrounding trade tensions.
      U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
  that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
  dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
  U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
      The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
  moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
  He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
  remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
  rise of the yen.
      The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
  in line with the Paris accord, he added.

955,"COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL
  The failure of the International Coffee
  Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas
  could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at
  least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.
      Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80
  cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.
      A special meeting between importing and exporting countries
  ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
  over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss
  quotas was set, delegates said.
      Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the
  International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after
  prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.
      With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer
  selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee
  roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.
      Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket
  shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.
      The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and
  exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the
  breakdown of the talks.
      Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and
  delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council
  adjourned, ""A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not
  prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective
  criteria.
      ""We want to insure that countries receive export quotas
  based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their
  political influence in the ICO.""
      Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster
  countered, ""Negotiations failed because consumers tried to
  dictate quotas, not negotiate them.""
      Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts
  exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market
  of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted
  quotas to continue under this basic scheme.
      But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers
  proposed carving up the export market on the basis of
  exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's
  share to 28.8 pct.
      Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes
  in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more
  readily available to consumers when they need it.
      A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest
  exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim
  proposal could not bring the two sides together.
      Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,
  illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on
  bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to
  protect its coffee export earnings.
      Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily
  on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and
  Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure
  to agree quotas, analysts said.
      The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as
  much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates
  forecast.
      The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full
  council is not due to meet again until September, delegates
  said.
  

",[35],['coffee'],"Coffee traders are anticipating a significant selloff in London coffee futures, potentially dropping prices to $1.00 or $0.80 per pound, due to the International Coffee Organization's (ICO) inability to reach an agreement on coffee export quotas. The breakdown in talks was attributed to Brazil's resistance to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria, while the U.S. insisted on quotas reflecting countries' supply capabilities. This failure to agree on quotas is expected to result in heavy producer selling, a price war among coffee roasting companies, and a subsequent drop in supermarket prices. The absence of quotas will likely impact developing coffee-producing countries, especially in Africa and Colombia, leading to potential losses of up to $3 billion annually."

  Energy analyst Edward Krapels said

  variable import tariff is most persuasive,"" Krapels, president

  Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.
      ""An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the

  of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House
  Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.
      ""An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the
  international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a
  barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax
  on transportation fuels,"" Krapels said.
      But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the
  oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price
  controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil
  companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax
  incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve
  exisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling
  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate.
      Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the
  subcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because
  funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources
  cannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices.

965,"EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES
  European Community (EC) industry
  ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of
  closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country
  bloc into reasonable balance with demand.
      The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary
  plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer
  which it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs.
      Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the
  scheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis for
  discussion, but did not go nearly far enough.
      Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of
  plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes,
  provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC
  or national governments for redundancy and other social costs.
      But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry
  Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln
  tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should
  be closed by the end of 1990.
      He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint
  the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products,
  typically produced in plants employing thousands of people.
      The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis
  that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to
  close.
      They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be
  expanded and developed through meetings among the industry
  body, the Commission and representatives of member states.
      However, diplomats said it was clear from today's
  discussions that such meetings will be difficult.
      They said member states are split on whether to reduce the
  scope of a quota production system, which at present protects
  EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of
  their products, while talks on the closure plan proceed.
      It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which
  EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on
  how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should
  come from Community coffers.
      German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel
  industry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer
  proportionately more than others, German sources said.
      But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw,
  insists that the profitability of companies should be taken
  into account.
      The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting from
  massive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, is
  currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black.
      Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint
  statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the
  industry.
  

",[22],['iron-steel'],"EC industry ministers have acknowledged the necessity of significant steel plant closures to balance capacity and demand within the 12-country bloc. The Eurofer plan, proposing closures that would affect 15.26 million tonnes of annual capacity and 22,000 jobs, was deemed insufficient by most ministers. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes suggested that 30 million tonnes of annual capacity should be closed by the end of 1990, particularly in the production of hot-rolled wide-strip products. Ministers agreed to expand and refine the Eurofer plan through discussions involving industry representatives, the Commission, and member states. However, disagreements emerged regarding the reduction of the quota production system and the distribution of closures and funding among member states, with Germany and the UK expressing contrasting positions."

971,"OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS
  OPEC may be forced to meet before a
  scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
  agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
  in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
      ""The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
  as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
  the problems,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
  Research Associates, CERA.
      Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
  faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
      ""OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
  issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said Paul Mlotok, oil
  analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
      He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
  ability to keep production under control have given way to a
  pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
  it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
      But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
  emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
  above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
      ""OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
  deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the
  regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
  on condition that he not be named. ""The market is now trying to
  teach them that lesson again,"" he added.
      David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
  to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
  not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
      ""They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
  winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
  when demand slackens,"" Mizrahi said.
      But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
  than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""
      Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
  OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
      ""OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
  since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said Dillard
  Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
      But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
  and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
  has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
  prompted excesses in its production.
      ""Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
  and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
  are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
  demand through current production,"" he told Reuters in a
  telephone interview.
  

",[86],['crude'],"OPEC may need to hold an emergency meeting before June to address the current decline in oil prices, according to analysts. The issue is not price but excess supply in the market, and OPEC's production is exceeding the 15.8 million bpd quota set in December. Some believe that OPEC must stick to its agreement for the next few months to stabilize prices, while others are skeptical that an emergency meeting will solve the problem. David Mizrahi predicts OPEC will meet before June but doubts they will reduce output, and Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani suggests that OPEC's production is actually meeting the current demand, which is higher than the set quota."

973,"OUTOKUMPU RESTRUCTURES COPPER DIVISION
  Finland's mining and metals group
  Outokumpu Oy &lt;OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of
  83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it
  restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt
  to rationalize production and improve profitability.
      Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a
  news conference the reorganization involved a split of the
  division into a new independent division with six profit
  centres.
      Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and
  taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It
  had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.
      Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in
  January 1986, &lt;Metallverken Ab> and &lt;Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that
  were merged into its copper processing division.
      The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last
  year, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion.
      The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products
  Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production

  Finland's mining and metals group
  Outokumpu Oy &lt;OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of
  83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it
  restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt
  to rationalize production and improve profitability.
      Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a
  news conference the reorganization involved a split of the
  division into a new independent division with six profit
  centres.
      Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and

  had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.
      Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in
  January 1986, &lt;Metallverken Ab> and &lt;Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that
  were merged into its copper processing division.
      The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last

  Gencorp said its RKO General
  subsidiary agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney
  Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and other
  adjustments at closing.
      The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO's
  application to renew the station's broadcast license would be
  dismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Television
  would be granted. Disney would then acquire privately held
  Fidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments.
      Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged in
  regulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.
      The deal is subject to prior approval by the Federal
  Communications Commission, the company said.
      Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a Los
  Angeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp &lt;WX> to
  settle the license proceedings and sell KHJ-TV for 313 mln
  dlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and the
  remainder to Fidelity. But on Jan 28, 1987, Westinghouse
  withdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it.
      In early 1986, Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WOR-TV in
  Secaucus, N.J., to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. The FCC has
  approved the transaction, but several parties have appealed.
      The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals,
  according to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohio-based Gencorp.
      Fidelity Television originally filed a competing
  application for the RKO license for KHJ, an independent
  station, in 1965.
      In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV in
  Boston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccurate
  financial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previously
  granted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ,
  to be denied.

The KHJ-TV license renewal has been disputed for over two decades, and previous attempts to sell the station have faced regulatory challenges. Gencorp had previously reached a deal with Fidelity and Westinghouse Electric Corp, but it fell through due to FCC disapproval.

984,"AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP
  The strong contribution of exports to
  the growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
  fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of
  the data, private economists polled by Reuters said.
      Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after
  rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year
  earlier.
      Equally significant was the decline in both private and
  government spending, they said.
      Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth
  quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau
  figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government
  spending by 0.2.
      Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
  Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account
  deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut
  imports appeared to be working.
      However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep
  growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports
  would increase and worsen the balance of payments.
      Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the
  result was positive because growth was export-driven.
      But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the
  growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.
      The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul
  Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.
      Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a
  reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline
  in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.
      A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter
  underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and
  public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's
  competitiveness, he said.
      ""It is clear that through the continued application of that
  strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its
  external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth
  pattern,"" he added.
  

","[34, 42, 33]","['gnp', 'bop', 'trade']","Australia's GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1986 was significantly influenced by a strong rise in exports, which increased by 13%, while imports only rose by 2.9%.

The decline in private and government spending, along with a decrease in consumer spending, also contributed to the GDP growth. Economists noted that this export-driven growth was encouraging, but cautioned that managing the pace of growth is crucial to avoid a potential increase in imports and a worsening of the balance of payments.

987,"GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS
  West Germany's chemical
  industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987
  turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef
  Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.
      Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,
  told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main
  dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as
  well as crude oil and commodity prices.
      Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming
  earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the
  start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.
      The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was
  badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was
  mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.
      Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and
  competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from
  lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price
  competition and increased costs.
      Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical
  firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved
  financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,
  neutralized the negative impact.
      Strenger said the industry would try to increase production
  in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of
  West Germany.
      The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in
  exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and
  22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.
      Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East
  exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.
      Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence
  following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late
  last year.
  

",[41],['earn'],"The German chemical industry is facing challenges that could impact its profitability, with a decline in exports, increased competition, and higher operating costs being the main concerns. The industry, which relies heavily on exports, experienced a 6.4% drop in exports in 1986, primarily due to the mark's appreciation and increased competition from US and British firms. Lower oil and commodity prices did not benefit the industry as they were offset by price competition and rising costs. Despite these challenges, the industry's financial position remains stable after three good years, and they aim to boost production in the US to compensate for lost export opportunities. However, the lower dollar and environmental concerns, such as chemical pollution of the Rhine, are additional factors that could negatively impact the industry's performance."

  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris
  last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the
  dollar.
      Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday:
  ""We don't have a target for the dollar."" He declined to comment
  on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: ""We
  really don't talk about the dollar.""
      He said protectionism was becoming ""extremely strong"" in the
  U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import
  barriers in other countries.
      ""The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's
  extremely strong,"" he said.
      ""As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged
  here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading
  system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.)
  goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path
  that the world did in the late 1930s,"" he said.
      While relative exchange rates had a role to play in
  defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer
  any solution, he said.
      ""You must address this problem on the exchange rate side,
  but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's
  far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of
  it requires a comprehensive approach,"" Baker said in the
  interview.
      Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to
  adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their
  barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any
  countries.
  

","[51, 83]","['money-fx', 'dlr']","James Baker, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, refutes the idea that the meeting in Paris established a target exchange rate for the dollar. He emphasizes the rising protectionist sentiment in the U.S. due to trade deficits and import barriers, and warns of the potential global consequences if the U.S. adopts protectionist measures. Baker suggests that addressing exchange rates is part of the solution, but it also requires a comprehensive approach, including currency adjustments and the removal of import barriers by other countries."
