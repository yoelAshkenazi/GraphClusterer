You will be given one summary written for an article. Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.
Please provide only a single integer in the range 1-5 as your answer, with no additional explanation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences.
The summary should be well-structured and well-organized. 
The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the summary and the source document carefully.
2. Evaluate how well the summary is structured and organized.
3. Consider how the information flows from one sentence to the next and whether the summary forms a cohesive narrative.
4. Assign a coherence score from 1 to 5.

Example:

Source Text:

The development of 3D printing technology has revolutionized various industries, from healthcare to automotive. With the ability to produce complex shapes and structures, 3D printing offers unprecedented customization and rapid prototyping capabilities. However, challenges remain in terms of material durability, cost-efficiency, and scalability for mass production. Researchers are continuously exploring new materials and methods to overcome these obstacles, aiming to make 3D printing a mainstream manufacturing technology.

Summary:

3D printing has greatly impacted healthcare, where it is used to create customized medical devices and implants. However, the technology is still expensive and difficult to scale. There are also concerns about the long-term durability of 3D printed materials. In addition to healthcare, the automotive industry is also exploring the use of 3D printing for prototyping and manufacturing small parts. Overall, while 3D printing holds great potential, it is not yet ready for widespread industrial use.
