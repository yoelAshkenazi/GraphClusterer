The use of biomass-derived carbons (BDCs) to prepare high-performance supercapacitors has been extensively investigated. Incorporating conductive additives (i.e. metal, metal sulfide, carbon nanotubes (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) reduces the internal resistance of BDCs and provides a high specific capacitance value. Composites of BDCs material often integrate the charge storage mechanism of electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor, hence improving the energy density of the BDCs electrode. This chapter explains the composites of biomass-derived materials and conductive materials, excluding conducting polymers, for supercapacitors applications..
