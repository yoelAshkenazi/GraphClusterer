The effect of the heat annealing process on the properties of the obtained compositions of different compositions has been revealed.The article presents the study results of parameters of the macroporous composite cohesion with glass composite parameters, basalt composite and metal reinforcement elements by the pull-out of the bar from a concrete cube. It has been established that the best joint operation of reinforcement element with macroporous composite can be ensured by the use of glass composite reinforcement element. Ultimate strength of its cohesion with macroporous composite of B7.5 (D1400), B10 (D1600) classes is 20-45% higher than the values of cohesion strength of basalt composite and metal reinforcement elements for all options of combining the classes by strength and diameter of reinforcement elements (âˆ… 6,8,10 mm). With increased strength class of the composite, ultimate strength of all the studied types of reinforcement elements is growing consistently.
