Abstract Additive manufacturing, known as 3D printing, has been widely applied in various fields owing to the development of 3D printing materials and 3D printing techniques. Compared with other fabrication approaches, 3D printing possesses the advantages of high resolution, high accuracy, unique customizability, and repeatability. Therefore, 3D printing can be widely used to fabricate various microstructures, including micromotors, which are capable of converting external energies into motion and subsequently accomplishing various functions. To date, five types of 3D printing techniques have been used to fabricate self‚Äêpropelled micromotors with different structures, ingredients, and functions.Abstract 3D printing has been extensively used for rapid prototyping as well as low-volume production in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries..
