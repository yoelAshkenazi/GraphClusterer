Interest in 3D (3- dimensional) printed optics and photonics by both industry and academic researchers is burgeoning, due to the unique features availed by 3D printing not achievable by traditional manufacturing techniques. 3D printing offers tremendous opportunities for developing new integrated systems in optics and photonics. Although a variety of manufacturing approaches have been developed, no single method can satisfy the requirement of small features, low roughness, and high speed simultaneously, thus opening up vast opportunities for innovations in 3D printed photonics..
