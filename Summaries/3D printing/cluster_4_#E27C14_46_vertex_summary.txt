Abstract: 3D printing in full three-dimensional printing also known as additive manufacturing is the process of making three-dimensional solid objects from a digital file.3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods. As a result, 3D printing creates less material wastage.This paper aims to present an overview and explore components or structures suitable for 3D printed concrete.To be more specific, it cannot fully consider the characteristics and advantages of 3D printing such as individualization and digitalization.Several 3D-printing-specific structure forms (including hollow form, tree form, and structure-functional form) are classified and the relevant successful cases are demonstrated. Moreover, the application potential of 3D printed concrete structures is illustrated and the limitations as well as the solutions for the application of 3D printed concrete in practical projects are also summarized.Based on the classification of different reinforcement materials, several reinforcement methods are intensively discussed for 3D printed concrete including steel bars, fibers and other reinforcement materials.The comparison of economic and environmental benefits between 3D concrete printing technology and traditional construction method is discussed respectively.The expected evolution of 3D printed structures is put forward and recommended.Three dimensional (3D) printing as an advanced manufacturing technology is progressing to be established in the pharmaceutical industry to overcome the traditional manufacturing regime of 'one size fits for all'.
