One of the most active areas of research today is 3D printing technology. Since the 1980s, the development of 3D printing technology has aroused interest worldwide and has begun to influence people’s thinking and way of life.Although existing energy storage devices (ESDs) that are prepared by traditional technologies can meet the demands of many application scenarios in our life, there are still many special application scenarios that cannot be implemented, such as flexible devices, wearable devices, and structural devices Three-dimensional (3D) printing, an advanced technology that can realize rapid production of structural objects, has been widely studied in tissue microﬂuidics, electronics, and engineering. The exploration of its application in ESDs has also been started by scientists in recent years.Recent advances in 3D printing technology have provided a new avenue for food manufacturing. However, one challenge in 3D printing food is the limited availability of printable materials that can mimic the properties of real food..
