The creation of a specific missile system with sea-based cruise missiles is determined by the principles of construction, solved goals and tasks.The priority areas for the development of promising missile weapons are factors such as: a combination of small weight and size character-istics of the missile and its area of an effective reflecting surface; optimization of flight altitude at cruise and final sections, at homing of cruise missiles on target; provision of antiosenitic ma-neuver and high speeds of cruise missiles flight to trajectories and much more.This article examines U.S. efforts to build a broad international coalition in the area of missile defense.The basic formats of military cooperation with foreign countries in the deployment of the U.S. global missile defense system are described, as well as the principles of cooperation on the part of the United States. A review of the regional missile defense systems created by the United States as an intermediate step on the way to a global missile defense system is provided..
