In this paper, Multi Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) radar and Anti-Radiation Missiles (ARMs) engagement is modeled using game theory. In this game, each player (radars and missiles) tries to maximize his payoff in Nash equilibrium point.To determine the nature and extent of Iranian casualties by ballistic missile attacks during the eight years of the Iraq-Iran war.The data collected about Iraqi missile strikes on Iranian cities included the following: date and time, number and type of missiles, cities targeted, and injuries and deaths resulting from impacts of missiles in civilian areas.
