Currently, nuclear power plays a quite visible role in the world electricity generation (~10%). However, before the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) severe accident in March of 2011, NPPs generated about 14% of the world’s electricity. Accounting that after, mainly, Chernobyl NPP severe accident a number of power reactors built and put into operation in the world decreased from 120 within 1985–1990 to about 22 per 5 years (within 1995–2015), we might face a significant shortage of operating power reactors within 2030– 2040. Therefore, it is important to evaluate current status of nuclear-power industry and to make projections on near (5–10 years) and far away (10-25 years and beyond) future trends in nuclear-power industry..
