The study of the physics of a nuclear chain reaction as a sequence of fission cycles has established a positive effect of asymptotic limiting of nuclear reactor power after the insertion of positive reactivity and raised the question whether a similar power asymptotic after the insertion of negative reactivity would occur, which could lead to the failure of the emergency protection function of the reactor to establish its subcritical state..
