A substantiation of possibility to use cryogenic nitrogen as working gas for tests in the wind tunnels is discussed.The results of numerical and physical experiments that obviously demonstrated a non-linear character of Reynolds number influence on characteristics of tested models are presented.This paper presents the results of a numerical investigation of the wind tunnel model relative size effect on experimentally obtained aerodynamic characteristics.The investigations were performed on computer-aided design geometry modeling the test section, plenum chamber, diffuser, and test object for the T-106 TsAGI transonic wind tunnel equipped with a closed-jet circular test section with perforated walls.A comparison is made between the calculation results for the model with conditionally infinite flow inside the test section and the experimental data.The calculations show that an increase in the relative size of the model leads to a decrease in the experimentally obtained lift-curve slope value, which is equal to one.Quantitative estimations were also made for the interference of the wind tunnel walls on the change in the flow velocity longitudinal component.The peculiarities of the flow through the perforated walls of the wind tunnel test section were also examined using visualization of the calculated results.This study considers a method of air flow cooling in closed-circuit wind tunnels by means of constant exhaust of a part of warm air and its change for colder outside air.
