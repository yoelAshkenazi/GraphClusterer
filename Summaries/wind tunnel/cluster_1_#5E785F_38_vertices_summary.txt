Results of the tests of aerodynamic stability of arched bridge in specialized wind tunnel are presented in this work. Atmospheric boundary layer properties were modeled in Landscape Wind tunnel of Krylov State Research Center to take into account wind characteristics â€“ changing of mean wind velocity with height, turbulence intensity and spectrums.. The results will aid in future simulations of the Ludwieg Tube wind tunnel, and for comparisons with experimental results from the Mach 6 Ludwieg Tube wind tunnel after it is installed, as well as with results from similar Ludwieg Tubes at other institutions.In order to predict the laminar/turbulent transition on a hypersonic vehicle forebody at Mach numbers 4 and 6, the three-dimensional (3D) modal linear stability analysis is applied, coupled with the eN method. Nevertheless, N factors are unknown for wind tunnel conditions..
