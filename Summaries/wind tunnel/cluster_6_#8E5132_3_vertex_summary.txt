Abstract Dynamics of a free-to-roll delta wing installed at high incidence in a wind tunnel is outlined using the experimental and mathematical modelling results. A simple analytical model applied allows us to simulate the multiattractor and chaotic dynamics observed in wind tunnel tests and thus to validate the used method for nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamics loads representation.At all stages of the life cycle of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there is a need for experimental studies of their characteristics. In part, experimental studies of this kind could be performed on installations such as traditional wind tunnels, However, in existing wind tunnels, it is not possible to regulate the air flow speed and study the influence of the aircraft's center of mass position, as is required for evaluating the flight dynamics of modern UAVs..
