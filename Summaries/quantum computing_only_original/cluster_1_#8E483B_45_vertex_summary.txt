This work is a study of the influence of the medium on the quantum system of qubits. The article assumes a description of the fundamentals of the quantum theory of information, as well as a place in it of the concept of quantum entanglement. A technique has been developed for correcting two basic types of quantum errors, based on the implementation and implementation of certain quantum schemes. The main difficulties in ensuring the protection of the quantum channel from various types of errors are analyzed and considered. The dependences of data distortion on noise and measures of decoherence on noise in one qubit are demonstrated..
