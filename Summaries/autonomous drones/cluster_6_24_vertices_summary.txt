Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) have a variety of applications in our daily life that have attracted the attention of many researchers around the world. There is also a significant interest in the development of new types of drones that can fly autonomously in different locations, such as cities, marine, and space environments and perform various missions. This paper reviews the different configurations, flight mechanisms, and applications of UASs. First of all, UASs are divided into four main categories, including Horizontal Takeoff and Landing (HTOL), Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL), Hybrid, and Bio-Based drones..
