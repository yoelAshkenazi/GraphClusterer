Abstract This paper describes the development of an autonomous robotic platform capable of undertaking rescue missions on rough terrain and other unpredictable environments.The key difference of this platform is the lack of LIDAR system and an algorithm that relies primarily on ultrasonic and optical sensors. As a result, two platforms were created, a fully autonomous drone and a scout bot that operate effectively together.In the recent past, development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has entered in the arena of bio-inspired flapping-wing drones, mainly due to their ability of flying at lower speed in a silent manner..
