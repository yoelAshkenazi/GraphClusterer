Nowadays one of the critical tasks for analyzing the usage of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as base stations is the development of effective UAV control strategies while servicing customers one the ground. The main problem is states within ultimate battery capacity, which limits the UAV's flight's duration and battery lifetime. This paper presents a scenario for placing UAVs on stationary objects, such as roofs, walls or balconies of buildings, in the process of providing communication services. Such a strategy provides drones to extend their autonomous work during the flight in the customer service area, as the main source of power consumption, the engine, can be turned off for long periods of time after arriving in a subscriber's service area. The paper compares the proposed scenario with the standard flight mode of UAVs.Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, have gained wide attention in recent years due to their potential of revolutionizing logistics and transportation.
