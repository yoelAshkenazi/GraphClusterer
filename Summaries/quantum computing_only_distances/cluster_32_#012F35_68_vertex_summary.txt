Using atoms as digital bits will start a completely new era in computer design. The author describes how such a quantum computer-a computer based on the rules of quantum mechanics-may work, and how it is going to give incredible speed and problem-solving power.Using atoms as digital bits will start a completely new era in computer design.Quantum computing is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the processing of information using quantum mechanics principles.All the quantum algorithms are based on a certain quantum computing model, varying from the quantum circuit, one-way quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation and topological quantum computation..
