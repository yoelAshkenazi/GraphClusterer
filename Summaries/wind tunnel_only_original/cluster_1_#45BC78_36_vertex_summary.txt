Abstract : In preparation for the arrival of a Mach 6 Ludwieg Tube at the United States Air Force Academy, a numerical simulation of the flow field within the test section of the wind tunnel has been undertaken. The results will aid in future simulations of the Ludwieg Tube wind tunnel, and for comparisons with experimental results from the Mach 6 Ludwieg Tube wind tunnel after it is installed, as well as with results from similar Ludwieg Tubes at other institutions.Various ways of increasing the Reynolds number, Re, in hypersonic wind tunnels were considered. Numerical and analytical investigations aimed at evaluating various methods of increasing the Re number in wind tunnels were performed with allowance for real gas effects (nitrogen or air) on stagnation pressures, p0, from 1 to 2000 MPa; stagnation temperatures, T0, from 300 to 3000 K; and Mach numbers, M, from 5 to 30.This study considers a method of air flow cooling in closed-circuit wind tunnels by means of constant exhaust of a part of warm air and its change for colder outside air..
