The data-driven model successfully learns the relationship between the velocity field and pressure experienced on the wall of the isolator, i.e., the trained CNN model successfully reconstructed the velocity field based on the wall pressure on the isolator with high accuracy.The simulation results indicate that the fuel conversion presents a similar distribution with temperature because the fuel conversion in scramjet cooling channels is co-decided by the temperature and velocity but the temperature plays the dominate role.For this reason, the present effort is summarizing and sharing the experimental data base developed in USA, Russia, China, Germany, Australia, France and Japan for studying the scramjet.In the present review, the pioneering supersonic combustion testing is presented first.Then all data are divided into groups according to the key components of scramjet for inlet-isolator, combustor either with step, cavity, or throttle, as well as, the fuel injector through wall or from a pylon.The collected entire data base includes a brief description of the geometric configurations, data measured, and testing conditions as a function of Mach number, temperature, pressure, and fuel mixture.The theoretical and the computational simulations directly related to the experiment are also included.We emphasize that the main attention in this review is given to model experiments; therefore, first of all, this review can be useful for engineers and scientists who are using numerical simulation of the thermo-gasdynamics of combustion processes for the purpose of validating the developing computer codes and kinetic models.The validation problem is also important in obtaining new experimental data for the conditions of experiments already performed, which undoubtedly raises the reliability and value of model experiments, which in the case of a multiple repetition of the results by different experimenters groups can be attributed as the "canonical" experiments or the benchmark tests..
