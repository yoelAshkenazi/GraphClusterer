Abstract An overview is given of the properties of two-dimensional smart photo-, thermo-, and electrochromic materials and devices used for the glazing of buildings and vehicles. It is shown that despite some commercial successes in the creation of materials and devices, further efforts are needed to improve their color neutrality, switching rate, bleached/colored contrast, and durability.As a building element, the facade which interacts with external factors between two different environmental conditions is an important interface in energy consumption and the building life cycle. In recent years, smart materials have become a research topic in the field of sustainable architecture and facade technologies. The traditional material understanding which expects materials to not be affected by external environmental conditions by preserving their qualities throughout their lifespan has begun to leave its place to the understanding of materials that change quality and energy by reacting to external stimuli..
