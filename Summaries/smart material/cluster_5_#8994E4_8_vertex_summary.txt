Abstract In recent years, lack of access to safe and pure water is one of the most critical issues in the world. Membrane technology is a promising technique for water treatment and is expected to play an increasingly important role in treatment areas such as drinking water, brackish and seawater desalination, and wastewater in the upcoming years, both on a domestic and on an industrial scale.Polymers and polymeric composite-based materials have been widely used as commercial membrane materials due to their wide range of advantages in terms of structure, morphology, physiochemical, and filtration characteristics.Currently, the usage of smart materials for polymeric membrane synthesis has intensified the membrane research toward a new class of membranes development and their applications in various fields.These stimuli-responsive smart materials could be designed to alter the membrane structure and physicochemical properties such as hydrophilicity, porosity, charge density, thermal and mechanical stability, etc.This chapter aims to summarize the recent scientific and technological advances of stimuli-responsive smart polymeric membrane materials for water and wastewater treatment applications.They can be classified based on the types of polymers, metal and metal oxide materials, carbon-based materials, or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which we will discuss in this chapter.The addition of the time dimension to three-dimensional (3D) printing has introduced four-dimensional (4D) printing technology, which has gained considerable attention in different fields such as medical, art, and engineering.Nowadays, bioscience has introduced some ideas which can be fulfilled by 4D printing.Blending time with variations caused by the situation has many beneficial aspects such as perceptibility and adaptability.Since 4D printing can create a dynamic structure with stimuli-responsive materials, the applications of smart materials, stimulus, and 3D printing are the effective criteria in 4D printing technology.Smart materials with their flexible properties can reshape, recolor, or change function under the effect of the internal or exterior stimuli.Thus, an attractive prospect in the medical field is the integration of the 4D printing approach along with smart materials.
