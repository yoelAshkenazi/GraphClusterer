Four-dimensional (4D)-printed smart materials and structures are engineered, complex-shaped mechanisms that behave by sensing external stimuli and responding by adapting to their environment, without any need for computerized control systems. These revolutionary products are no longer relegated to the realm of science fiction and have implications for 4D printing (4DP). This chapter overviews the first book in series, “Smart Materials and Structures: 4D Printing Principles and Manufacturing” and provides a preliminary information on 4D-printed smart materials and structures as well as their significance.Abstract The addition of the time dimension to three-dimensional (3D) printing has introduced four-dimensional (4D) printing technology, which has gained considerable attention in different fields such as medical, art, and engineering..
