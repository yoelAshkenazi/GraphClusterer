Stimuli-responsive smart materials that can be prepared by various methods have the ability to sense and respond to various kinds of physical and chemical stimuli in their environment. These materials have many potential applications in fibrous materials in the fields of medicine, protection, security communication, and textile electronics.AbstractPhysical-chemical principles of the operation of smart materials were considered. It was established that the work of the smart materials is founded on the principles of the operation of cooperative systems â€” the systems of the limiting dimensions. Nonadditivity (cooperativity) of the operation of the systems is conditioned by the effect of the change of the system as a whole in the processes that proceed. The properties of the biological and cooperative systems are qualitatively equal, except for the properties of the biological systems connected with the transfer of the information.Ferromagnetic shape memory alloys (FSMAs) are a recently-discovered member of smart materials.
