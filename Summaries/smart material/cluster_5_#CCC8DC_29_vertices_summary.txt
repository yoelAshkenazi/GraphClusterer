Smart materials are a kind of functional materials which can sense and response to environmental conditions or stimuli from optical, electrical, magnetic mechanical, thermal, and chemical signals, etc. Patterning of smart materials is the key to achieving large-scale arrays of functional devices. Over the last decades, printing methods including inkjet printing, template-assisted printing, and 3D printing are extensively investigated and utilized in fabricating intelligent micro/nano devices, as printing strategies allow for constructing multidimensional and multimaterial architectures..
