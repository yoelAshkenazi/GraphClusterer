“Additive manufacturing (AM)” or “rapid prototyping” is a flourishing technology that has created a vast space in manufacturing industries. Its application zones cover several areas, including the biomedical, aerospace, military, and automotive industries. Recently, a great advancement in AM of complex architectures, which are impossible or difficult to produce otherwise, has been reported.With 4D printing, time is treated as the fourth dimension, allowing printed structures to change their form independently. These products, created from “smart materials,” respond to stimuli such as light, temperature, water, or pH, changing their shape and creating structures that can adapt and respond to their surroundings..
