It’s been almost a decade that the idea of smart materials has attracted man’s attention. These materials are capable of responding to their surrounding environment and of adapting to it. The development pace of construction materials has also been towards multi-purpose and smart materials, which would ultimately result in manufacturing phase matters. In fact, the existence of smart structural materials and systems has played a substantial role in developing the idea of the smart control of a construction. These materials can improve designing methods and the construction of buildings. In the sustainable buildings design approach (a new approach to designing buildings which should meet a high level of environmental standards with an emphasis on the costs of their useful lifespan), such highly efficient materials are used because they are more adaptable to the environment and increase a building’s useful lifespan. In this article, some of the smart materials used for the façade are introduced and their performances will be studied.
