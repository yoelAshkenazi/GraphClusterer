Field tests proved the feasibility and perspectives of autonomous LIDAR sensing of agricultural fields from drones for the detection and location of plants under stress.We have developed the ultracompact (~300 g) fluorescence LIDAR and installed it on a quadrocopter for remote sensing of vegetation. LIDAR was based on diode laser (405 nm, 150 m W) and mini-spectrometer but the instrument can acquire fluorescence spectra from a 8 m distance..
