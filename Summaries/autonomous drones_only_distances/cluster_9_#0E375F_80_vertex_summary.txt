Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today. The most important task is today the attempt to create on the basis of system of technical sight completely autonomous system of navigation for motor transport, the marine transport and aircraft. In article the problem of creation of such system for the drone which is carrying out research or rescue operations on the difficult area is considered. The main objective of system is finding of footpaths among trees on which the drone can follow.The paper presents algorithms for constructing a map using a graph of factors and correcting errors by recognizing a place using a Siamese convolutional neural network.The experimental results obtained with the use of a nano-drone in the autonomous flight mode are presented.The constructed map of the area was evaluated for consistency by a numerical method.In the recent decade, the rapid development of drone technologies has made many spatial problems easier to solve, including the problem of 3D reconstruction of large objects..
