3D printing technology has made significant advancements and is finding applications across various industries, including construction. This technology offers a new approach to building structures. The focus is on 3D printed concrete, highlighting the material requirements and commonly used building materials. While the technology has made progress, there are challenges, such as the current inability to print ready-mixed concrete with coarse aggregates. However, a case study of a 3D concrete printer that overcomes this limitation details the entire printing process for a power distribution substation. This real-world application provides valuable insights and construction experience for future 3D concrete printing projects, offering a glimpse into the potential and prospects of this innovative construction method.
