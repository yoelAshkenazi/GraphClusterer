The use of 3D printing technologies has been extensively explored in various fields, including tissue engineering, energy storage, and optoelectronics. In tissue engineering, 3D printing techniques such as direct 3D printing, 3D-Bioplotter printing, and fused deposition modeling have shown success in creating scaffolds for tissue regeneration, which have been used in clinical trials for bone defect restoration and other applications. The advancements and potential of 3D printing in this field highlight the importance of hybrid approaches and controlled drug delivery. In energy storage, 3D printing is being utilized to create structural energy storage devices, particularly for specialized applications like flexible and wearable devices, and current progress in fabricating structural lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and other types of energy storage devices using 3D printing has been made. The study of 3D printing for precise nanocellulose structures and microfluidic devices demonstrates the importance of optimizing printing parameters and material properties, with studies focusing on adjusting lignin concentrations and twin-screw extruder parameters to improve adhesion in high-concentration nanocellulose 3D printed structures, and relating printing parameters to surface roughness and wetting properties.
