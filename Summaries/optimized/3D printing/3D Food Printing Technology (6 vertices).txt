3D food printing is an innovative technology that has gained traction in the food industry, offering various benefits such as customization, nutritional enhancement, and the ability to create complex food structures. The importance of considering safety, labeling, and legal frameworks when discussing 3D-printed foods is crucial, as decentralized and localized production requires ensuring food safety and providing proper labeling. Research has been conducted to understand the relationship between material properties, printing conditions, and the physical attributes of printed foods, including the customization of food design, texture, and taste perception. Various 3D food printing technologies, including extrusion, powder binding, and inkjet printing, each with its advantages and limitations, have been explored, and the use of hydrogel-based inks shows promise for customized food products, but challenges remain in improving printability and mechanical properties.
