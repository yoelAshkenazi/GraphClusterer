3D food printing is an innovative technology that has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize the food industry. It enables the creation of customized food products with tailored nutritional content, textures, and shapes, as demonstrated by the development of nutrient-dense cookies using underutilized ingredients. The key to successful 3D food printing lies in understanding the relationship between material properties, printing conditions, and the physical attributes of the printed food. Safety, labeling, and legal considerations are crucial to ensure consumer trust and protection. Various 3D food printing techniques, such as extrusion, powder binding, and inkjet printing, each have their advantages and limitations. The choice of technique depends on the desired food product and its properties. Improving the printability and mechanical properties of hydrogel-based inks is necessary to unlock the full potential of 3D food printing. Overall, 3D food printing offers exciting opportunities for customization and innovation in the food industry, but it also presents challenges related to safety, acceptability, and technical limitations. Overcoming these challenges will be essential for the widespread adoption of 3D food printing.
