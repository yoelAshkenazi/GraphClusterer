3D printing technologies have shown great potential in various fields, including tissue engineering, energy storage, and microfluidics. These technologies enable the fabrication of intricate and functional structures, such as scaffolds for tissue regeneration, structural energy storage devices, and microfluidic devices. 3D printing techniques like direct 3D printing and 3D-Bioplotter printing have been successful in pre-clinical settings for regenerating different tissue types and have been used in clinical trials for bone restoration and disease treatment. In energy storage, 3D printing is being explored for fabricating structural batteries and other energy storage devices, particularly promising for flexible, wearable, and structural devices. Extrusion-based 3D printing can create precise structures with high nanocellulose concentrations, and optimizing lignin concentrations and printing parameters can enhance mechanical properties and shape retention of 3D printed structures. Additionally, 3D printing is applied in microfluidics, where digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing is utilized.
