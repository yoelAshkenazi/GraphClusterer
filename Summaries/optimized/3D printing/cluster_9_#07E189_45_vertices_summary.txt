3D printing allows decentralization and localized production of foods when food printing enters into business trade with the globalization of 3D-printed foods. Even though 3D printing delivers foods based on localized demand, it is crucial to provide proper labeling of 3D-printed foods. The storage stability of 3D-printed foods is equally important as that of the optimization of printability. The significance of postprocessing and end quality of 3D-printed foods are highlighted in this chapter. Thus, the sustenance of food printing relies on not only the technical development but also the practical implementation with societal and economic implications in the food supply and distribution chain. Conclusion: 3D printing can be used to improve anatomy understanding and surgical planning..
