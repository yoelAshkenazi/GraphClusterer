The NIH has introduced the NIH 3D Print Exchange, a groundbreaking online platform that addresses the scarcity of scientific 3D models and the expertise needed to create and validate them. This platform benefits researchers and educators by offering a reliable source for discovering and creating precise 3D models relevant to bioscience. Users can generate ready-to-print 3D files from various data types, including molecular structures, microscopy images, and CT scans, thanks to the innovative web-based tools provided by the exchange. This promotes open data sharing in a community-driven environment and makes 3D printing more accessible for scientific research and education. The growing application of 3D printing in manufacturing complex electronics and energy devices, such as batteries, has seen recent advancements in developing 3D-printed batteries using various printing methods. The potential for 3D-printed batteries to offer advantages in durability, safety, and energy density indicates a promising future for this technology in various fields.
