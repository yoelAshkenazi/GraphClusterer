The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has introduced the NIH 3D Print Exchange, an innovative platform addressing the need for accessible and scientifically accurate 3D models in research and education. This online portal aims to bridge the gap between the limited availability of scientific 3D models and the growing demand for 3D printing in various fields. By offering user-friendly tools, the NIH enables users to create 3D-print-ready files from diverse data sources, fostering a community-driven environment for data sharing. The initiative is particularly significant as 3D printing technology is increasingly being utilized in the fabrication of complex electronic devices, including batteries, due to its flexibility, precision, and cost-effectiveness. Advancements in 3D printing techniques such as lithography, electrodeposition, and inkjet printing are being employed to create 3D-printed batteries with improved performance and safety, highlighting the potential for 3D printing to revolutionize the development of energy devices, emphasizing the importance of continued research and development in this field.
