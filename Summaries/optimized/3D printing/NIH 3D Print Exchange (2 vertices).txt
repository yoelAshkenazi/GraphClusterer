The NIH 3D Print Exchange is a groundbreaking online platform that aims to revolutionize the accessibility and creation of bioscientifically relevant 3D models for printing. This initiative addresses the lack of scientific 3D models available online and the expertise gap in generating and validating such models. By offering user-friendly tools, the platform enables researchers and educators to create 3D-print-ready files from various scientific data sources, fostering open data sharing and collaboration. The recent progress in 3D printing technologies for batteries emphasizes methods like lithography-based printing, electrodeposition, and direct ink writing. Achievements in printing battery components highlight the potential for developing high-performance, safe, and durable 3D-printed batteries. The NIH 3D Print Exchange plays a crucial role in making this technology more accessible and applicable in scientific research and education.
