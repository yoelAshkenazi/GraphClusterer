Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is gaining prominence in various sectors, including healthcare and clothing. The technology's importance in healthcare is emphasized, particularly in understanding its capabilities for anatomical models, surgical planning, and patient education, but there is a need for regulation and quality control to ensure accuracy and safety. In the medical field, 3D printing has shown promise in cardiovascular medicine, particularly in complex anatomies and surgical planning, with studies demonstrating its value in cardiopulmonary disease, and personalized 3D-printed models providing information beyond traditional visualization tools. The technology is also being used in the assessment and surgical planning of mitral valve (MV) disease, with patient-specific 3D printed models offering a unique perspective and additional information for health professionals. A study has validated the precision and usefulness of 3D modelling and printing technology in producing patient-specific 3D MV models, and this technology has the potential to be applied in various medical areas, both clinically and educationally. The establishment of a 3D printing registry aims to collect data and support future reimbursement efforts for clinical 3D printing.
