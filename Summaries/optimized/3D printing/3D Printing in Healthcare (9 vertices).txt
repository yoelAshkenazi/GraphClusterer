The various applications and implications of 3D printing technology in healthcare, particularly in radiology and cardiovascular medicine, include the use of anatomical models, surgical planning, and patient education, emphasizing the need for regulation and quality control to ensure accuracy and safety. The selection of printers and software, as well as the creation of 3D models, are important considerations, and radiologists have the potential to play a leading role in guiding this emerging technology. 3D printing is a valuable tool for understanding complex anatomies and planning interventions in cardiovascular medicine, with studies demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy in mitral valve and atrial septal defect assessment and surgical planning. Proper documentation and reimbursement for 3D printed models in healthcare are crucial, with efforts being made to establish a 3D printing registry for data collection and future reimbursement support. A thorough understanding, regulation, and further research are necessary to maximize the benefits of this technology in clinical settings.
