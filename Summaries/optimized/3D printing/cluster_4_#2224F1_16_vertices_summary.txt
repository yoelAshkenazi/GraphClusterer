Abstract Object 3D printing technology has becoming more and more popular in medicine, we aim to describe the application experiences of 3D printing technology in endoscopic surgery for skull base tumors, with the assessment of 3D-printed models in skull base endoscopic surgery simulation and anatomy learning.From the perspective of the features of effective vertical and overhanging construction, the spray-based three-dimensional (S-3D) mortar printing technology has promoted the application of 3D printing in construction fields. Carbon fibers were used to optimize the mechanical performance of S-3D printed mortar. The effects of carbon fiber volume (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%) and length (3 and 5 mm) on the working properties, printing accuracy, mechanical properties, and microstructural properties of the S-3D printed mortar were studied comprehensively. The test results showed that the S-3D printed mortar with the 1.5 vol% and 3 mm length carbon fiber (L3-V1.5 specimen) showed optimal printing accuracy in the single-layer and accumulative thickness tests. The S-3D printed L3-V1.5 mortar had the maximum flexural strength, which increased by 53.06% and 39.96% at 7 and 28 days, respectively, more than those of its cast counterparts. In addition, the S-3D printing process enhanced the interlayer bonding strength, and the ultimate interlayer splitting strength of the S-3D printed L3-V1.5 mortar increased by 2.16% and 3.33% at 7 and 28 days, respectively, more than those of the cast mortar without carbon fibers.
