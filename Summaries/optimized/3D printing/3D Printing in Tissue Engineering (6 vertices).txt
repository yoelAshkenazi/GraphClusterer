3D printing technologies have various applications and advancements in fields such as tissue engineering, energy storage, and optoelectronics. In tissue engineering, 3D printing is used to create scaffolds for tissue regeneration, with techniques like direct 3D printing, 3D-Bioplotter printing, and stereolithography showing success in pre-clinical settings and being investigated for clinical applications. The potential of 3D printing in fabricating structural energy storage devices, especially flexible and wearable devices, is also highlighted, with researchers exploring its use in creating lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and other structural energy storage devices to improve electrochemical performances. Extrusion-based 3D printing is used to manufacture precise nanocellulose structures, with a focus on improving adhesion between layers by blending lignin and optimizing printing parameters. Digital light processing 3D printing is utilized in microfluidics to create microscale 3D structures, with the study of surface wetting characteristics crucial for device performance. Freeform 3D printing is used to fabricate artificial tissues with vascularized structures, emphasizing the importance of material properties and matching between printing ink and supporting matrices.
