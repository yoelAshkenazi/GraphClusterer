The global nuclear energy landscape is rapidly evolving, with a focus on addressing global warming and developing advanced reactor technologies. Various aspects of nuclear reactors, including types, classifications, advantages, and challenges, are being explored, with an emphasis on nuclear safety and the need for advanced safety measures and nuclear roadmaps. Modular high-temperature nuclear reactors (VHTR) show potential for electricity and heat generation, as well as hydrogen production. The nuclear fuel cycle is being analyzed, including the use of minor actinides as fuel and the potential of hybrid thermonuclear reactors in existing nuclear power systems. A two-circuit nuclear facility with an inherently safe fast reactor is being explored for cost-effective electricity generation. A closed nuclear fuel cycle with fast reactors is proposed, addressing issues such as mixed uranium-plutonium fuel production, spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, and fuel reuse in fast-breeder reactors. The physicochemical properties of molten salts and their optimal application in nuclear technology are also being investigated. Nuclear reactor core design is crucial, with the Fuel-to-Moderator volume ratio (V_F/V_M) impacting various parameters, as demonstrated by a simulation of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) with different lattice pitches.
