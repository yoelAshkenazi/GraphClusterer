Abstract The scientific, engineering and production capability that has been developed in our country in the field of nuclear shipbuilding is of exceptional value. In nuclear shipbuilding technologies, a special concept of a modular reactor plant has been formed, which is characterized by an extremely small footprint required to accommodate a steam generating plant in a limited space of the reactor compartment, enhanced reliability and survivability. Based on the experience in creating and improving marine and naval reactor plants, JSC “Afrikantov OKBM” has developed a number of designs of innovative reactor plants for small-and medium-sized nuclear energy sources..
