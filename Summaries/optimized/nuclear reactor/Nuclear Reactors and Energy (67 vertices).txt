Nuclear reactors' design, operation, safety, and fuel cycle are discussed, exploring challenges and opportunities associated with different types, such as boiling water reactors, pressurized water reactors, and water-water energetic reactors. Modular high-temperature nuclear reactors' potential for electricity and heat generation, as well as hydrogen production, is also delved into. Nuclear reactors' role in addressing global warming is emphasized, with the development of Gen III+ Pressurized Water Reactors and Small Modular Reactors crucial for short-term and long-term strategies. Research reactors, particularly advanced Multi-Purpose Research Reactors, are highlighted for advancing nuclear power plant technology and other high-tech systems. Nuclear safety is a recurring theme, with discussions on developing safe and efficient nuclear reactors, such as the BREST-OD-300 and the SVBR-75/100. Molten salt reactors and the closed nuclear fuel cycle with fast reactors are proposed as a promising direction for nuclear energy's future. Radioactive waste management, particularly spent nuclear fuel, is a significant concern, with the suggested use of minor actinides as fuel to reduce waste volume.
