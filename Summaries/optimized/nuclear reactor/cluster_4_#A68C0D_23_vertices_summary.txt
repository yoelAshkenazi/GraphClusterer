In nuclear reactor, spatial oscillations in neutron flux distribution resulting from xenon reactivity feedback are a matter of concern. If the oscillations in power distribution are not controlled, power density and rate of change of power at some locations in the reactor core may exceed their respective limits causing the nuclear power plant instability. Therefore, during the design stages of any Pressurized Water Nuclear Reactor (P.W.R), it is necessary to identify the existence of xenon oscillation and to design suitable control strategy for regulating the spatial power distribution. In each nuclear power plant, Load-following control is one of the most important techniques for nuclear reactor regulation. A novel nonlinear controller called observer-based adaptive robust feedback-linearization controller for VVER-1000 nuclear reactors is presented in this paper. The reactor core is simulated based on the validated four nodes kinetics reactor model and three groups of delayed neutron precursor’s concentration based on the Skinner-Cohen model. Considering the limitations of the xenon concentrations and delayed neutrons precursor’s densities physical measurement, an adaptive sliding mode observer is designed to estimate their values and finally adaptive robust feedback-linearization based on the adaptive sliding mode observer and nodal kinetics reactor model is presented to AO control during load following operation for nuclear reactors..
