Nuclear technology and its applications are explored in various regions and industries, including the potential of nuclear reactors for desalination in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, where theoretical and economic aspects of adopting this technology are discussed, highlighting the International Atomic Energy Agency's involvement in such projects. China is developing advanced nuclear reactor systems, including the China Lead-based Reactor and its variants, which are part of an engineering project for nuclear waste transmutation. Computational Fluid Dynamics methods are used in nuclear reactor engineering for detailed simulations and applications in various nuclear power plant equipment. Safety in fusion reactors is also addressed, reviewing the evolution of safety goals for nuclear reactors and proposing a hierarchical framework for fusion quantitative safety goals, considering occupational exposure, routine releases, accidents, and radioactive waste management. Nuclear technology has diverse applications and considerations, from desalination and advanced reactor designs to safety frameworks, highlighting ongoing research and development in the field.
