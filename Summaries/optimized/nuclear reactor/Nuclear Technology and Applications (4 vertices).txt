Nuclear technology and its applications are discussed in various regions and reactor types. The potential of nuclear desalination in the Middle East and North Africa, specifically in Saudi Arabia, is highlighted, and the feasibility of small modular nuclear reactors for this purpose is explored. Technical and economic analysis of specific nuclear reactor designs, CAREM and SMART, is also delved into. China's advancements in nuclear reactor technology, particularly the development of an accelerator-driven subcritical system for nuclear waste transmutation, are noted, including the China Lead-based Reactor and its role in ADS and Generation IV lead-cooled fast reactor technology. Computational Fluid Dynamics is applied in nuclear reactor engineering for thermal-hydraulic analysis, with the development of high-fidelity thermal-hydraulic models and the potential to enhance reactor design and analysis. Safety goals for fusion reactors are also established, considering occupational radiation exposure, routine releases of radioactive materials, accidents, and radioactive waste management, with a historical overview of safety goals for nuclear reactors and a proposed framework for fusion reactor safety. Overall, topics related to nuclear technology, including desalination potential, reactor design and development, safety considerations, and the application of advanced computational methods, are covered.
