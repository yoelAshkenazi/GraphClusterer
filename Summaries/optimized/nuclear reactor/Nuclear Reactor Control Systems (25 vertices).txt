Nuclear power plants have various aspects, including reactor control, safety, and efficiency. Generation IV nuclear energy systems use heat pipes for control and the Directed Reactor Auxiliary Cooling System (DRACS) for advanced high-temperature reactors and small modular reactors, highlighting the potential of heat pipes for small reactors and their role in changing fuel amounts within the reactor. Cooling extremely hot nuclear fuel during accidents is a critical safety issue that thermal hydraulics can help solve. Xenon oscillations in nuclear reactors can lead to instability if not controlled, but an adaptive robust control system based on a multipoint kinetics reactor model can maintain these oscillations within safe limits. Accurate modeling is important for reactor core control, and various modeling approaches, power control methods, and load-following control techniques are used. Cellular neural networks can model and solve the nuclear reactor's dynamic equations, offering a novel approach to understanding the reactor's behavior. Safety considerations include the power behavior of a point nuclear reactor during staged insertion of large negative reactivity, highlighting the importance of emergency protection systems.
