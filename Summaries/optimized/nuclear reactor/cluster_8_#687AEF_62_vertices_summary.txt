The circuit of complex nuclear powered submarines (NPS) recycling accepted now is reduced to containerization of the highly active equipment of reactor installations in volume of reactor compartment and to time storage of reactor compartment afloat in the multi compartment block structure. Works on one compartment blocks formation for storage on the firm basis now are in an initial stage. Radioecological danger of mass afloat storage removed of operation NPS and cut out reactor compartments essentially grows, if from a reactor spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is not unloaded.The first key problems of modern nuclear reactors are inability of closed nuclear cycle, problems with spent nuclear fuel, poor effectiveness of nuclear fuel and heat-exchange equipment usage. Dealing with problems consists in usage of fast-neutron reactors with steam coolant.The concept for the development of two-component nuclear energy based on the joint operation of thermal and fast neutron reactors and the creation of a closed fuel cycle was adopted in Russia to implement this process and solve crucial problems of nuclear power.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term..
