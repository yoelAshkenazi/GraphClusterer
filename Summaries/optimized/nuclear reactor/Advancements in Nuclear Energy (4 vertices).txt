Nuclear energy-related topics, including desalination technology, nuclear reactor development, and safety considerations, are discussed. The growing interest in desalination technology in the Middle East is highlighted, with a focus on small modular nuclear reactors and IAEA-assisted projects. The potential for nuclear reactor adoption in Saudi Arabia and the use of theoretical and computational techniques for nuclear desalination are explored. China's efforts in developing an accelerator-driven subcritical system for nuclear waste transmutation, with the CLEAR reactor as a reference, are also mentioned. The application of CFD methods in nuclear reactor engineering is emphasized, showcasing its potential for detailed 3D flow and heat transfer simulations. Research achievements in this area are noted, including the development of high-fidelity thermal-hydraulic models and multi-scale/multi-physics coupling platforms. Safety goals for nuclear reactors, particularly fusion reactors, are addressed, and a hierarchical framework is proposed to ensure safety from the design stage, considering occupational exposure, routine releases, accidents, and radioactive waste management. Nuclear energy advancements, safety considerations, and the application of advanced technologies in the field offer insights into the current and future state of nuclear energy research and development.
