The global energy demand is expected to increase significantly with population growth, necessitating the development of sustainable and clean energy sources like nuclear power. Innovative nuclear energy systems, such as Generation IV reactors, are being proposed to replace the current Gen II/III reactors, aiming to enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Key safety issues include the cooling of nuclear fuel during accidents, addressed through thermal hydraulics, and controlling xenon oscillations to maintain stability using advanced control systems like adaptive robust control and observer-based nonlinear control. Different modeling approaches, such as point reactor core modeling and multi-point kinetics reactor models, are essential for understanding reactor behavior and designing control systems. The study of reactor kinetics is crucial for predicting reactor behavior during reactivity changes and ensuring the effectiveness of emergency protection systems. Advanced control techniques like Quantitative Feedback Theory and balance model reduction are used for optimal control of nuclear reactors, while innovative methods like cellular neural networks are used for modeling and solving spatio-temporal behavior of reactor cores. Accurate measurement and control of various parameters in nuclear reactors are also important.
