Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has made significant advancements and has various applications across industries. Progress has been made in 3D-printed batteries, with different printing methods impacting battery performance, and creating complex-shaped electronics with improved efficiency and reduced waste. 3D food printing aims to enhance customization, on-demand production, and geometric complexity in food, reproducing traditional foods and developing stable, shape-retaining food products. A high-throughput fabrication technique using two-photon lithography addresses the need for faster and more complex 3D printing. The optimization of 3D printing parameters for epoxy systems improves the process for large-scale applications. 3D printing also applies to RF connectors, showcasing potential for customization and performance in high-frequency applications, and to electrodes for supercapacitors, creating complex structures and optimizing performance. A novel 3D printing process using functional lithography resins results in parts with superior physical and chemical properties, and an automated testing and characterization method has been proposed.
