Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a rapidly evolving field with diverse applications, from electronics and energy devices to food production and mechanical engineering. The ability to create complex structures with high precision and customization has led to significant advancements in various industries. 3D printing is being utilized to fabricate batteries and supercapacitors with improved performance and flexibility, with various methods and applications in battery manufacturing emphasizing the importance of developing long-lasting and safe batteries. Researchers have also demonstrated the reproduction of traditional foods like pizza and the creation of grain and protein-based products with improved shape stability during cooking. Advancements in two-photon lithography-based submicrometer additive manufacturing have increased throughput and expanded the geometric design space, enabling the production of complex nanostructures, and the development of a novel functional lithography resin has led to 3D printed parts with superior physical and chemical properties.
