3D printing technology, also known as additive manufacturing, is advancing across various fields. Complex-shaped electronics, such as batteries, are being created through different 3D printing methods, with progress in electrode and electrolyte development, although future challenges remain. 3D food printing is also being explored, with an emphasis on customization, on-demand production, and geometric complexity, as seen in examples like pizza and shape-stable grain and protein products. A high-throughput fabrication technique, two-photon lithography, is being used to create nanoscale features in 3D structures, addressing speed limitations through parallelization. 3D-printed epoxy is being developed for composite tooling applications, with key printing parameters identified for latent-cured epoxy systems. 3D-printed SubMiniature version A connectors for radio-frequency circuits are being designed and tested, showcasing their flexibility, performance, and durability. 3D printing is also being used to create customized energy storage devices, specifically supercapacitors, with research focused on fabrication processes and materials used. A successful case study by polySpectra resulted in an efficient and economic 3D printing process for production parts using novel functional lithography resins.
