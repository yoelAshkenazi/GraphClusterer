Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has become an increasingly prominent manufacturing method, offering unique advantages in various industries. This technology involves the layer-by-layer construction of 3D objects using a range of materials, including polymers, metals, ceramics, and even human tissues. The process begins with a 3D model, which is sliced into layers by a slicing program and then converted into machine-readable code. This code directs the system to build the object by layering materials such as liquid resin, powder, or solid filaments. Additive manufacturing has gained significant attention in the medical field due to its ability to create patient-specific complex components, high material utilization, support for tissue growth, and customized services. It has been particularly impactful in the production of implants, prosthetics, and medical devices, offering personalized solutions and improved patient outcomes. The technology has also found applications in aerospace, automotive, energy, and other sectors, where it enables the fabrication of complex parts with intricate geometries and functional graded materials. Various processes, including powder bed fusion, direct energy deposition, material jetting, binder jetting, and sheet lamination, each have their own advantages and limitations. The impact of process parameters and material properties on the final product emphasizes the importance of understanding the interplay between these factors. The potential of additive manufacturing in creating biomimetic 3D structures for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is also highlighted.
