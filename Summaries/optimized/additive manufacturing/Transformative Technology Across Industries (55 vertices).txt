Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology with diverse applications across multiple industries. The process involves the layer-by-layer construction of objects, enabling the creation of complex structures with high precision and customization. The technology has evolved from its early days in the 1980s, when stereolithography was first invented, to the present, where it is used in various fields such as medicine, aerospace, automotive, and education. The advantages of additive manufacturing are numerous, allowing for the creation of personalized implants, prosthetics, and medical devices in the healthcare sector, revolutionizing patient care. In the aerospace and automotive industries, it enables the production of complex, lightweight structures, improving performance and fuel efficiency. In education, 3D printing can serve as a powerful tool for teaching design and engineering principles. However, challenges associated with additive manufacturing include optimizing processes, materials, and applications, as well as addressing the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts and the economic viability of the technology. Despite these challenges, the potential of additive manufacturing is immense, offering unprecedented design freedom and allowing for the creation of complex geometries.
