Additive manufacturing (AM) and its applications across different industries are explored in the context of sustainability and technological advancements. The integration of AM with Industry 4.0 emphasizes automation, digitization, and sustainability in manufacturing processes. AM has the potential to create sustainable manufacturing solutions by producing customized, cost-effective products with reduced waste, but challenges exist in implementing it as a sustainable method. In ceramic fabrication, additive technology offers high precision and quality compared to traditional techniques. Metal AM processes like selective laser sintering and electron beam melting are superior to traditional techniques but have limitations such as high production costs and residual stress, while beamless metal AM techniques offer new possibilities for industrial production. In the construction industry, 3D printing technologies enable the creation of unique structural elements and architectural designs, emphasizing the importance of modifying additives and reinforcing fibers to achieve maximum structural quality. AM is also used in biomedical applications such as bone substitution and tissue regeneration, allowing for customized solutions.
