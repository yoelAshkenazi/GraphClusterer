The article analyzes the use of 3D-printing technologies in the construction industry.The main trends in the development of this area related to the development of modern software for 3D printers, printer designs and forming extrusion heads of printers, and also to the development of formulations of building mixes used for 3D printing are noted.The relevance of the use of 3D printing technologies using concrete is conditioned by the creation of unique structural elements, objects of landscape gardening architecture or buildings. From the point of view of building materials science, this task includes considering technological factors, and, in particular, the requirements for the concrete mixture. The special attractiveness of these technologies is associated with the possibility of carrying out work on a construction site, with a high degree of mechanization of processes and with an increasing of labor productivity when performing construction and installation work..
