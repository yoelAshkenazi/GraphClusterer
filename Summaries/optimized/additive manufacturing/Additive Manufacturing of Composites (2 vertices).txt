Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the production of various materials, including cermets and polymer composites. AM techniques like selective laser sintering/melting, laser engineering net shaping, and binder jet 3D printing have been explored to create bulk cermet components, offering advantages over traditional methods. These processes combine ceramic and metallic phases, resulting in materials with unique properties. Research on AM-produced cermets highlights the potential to overcome limitations of conventional manufacturing. For polymer composites, AM methods such as stereolithography, SLS, fused filament fabrication, fused deposition modeling, and binder jetting have been utilized to enhance the mechanical properties of polymer-based structures. This approach addresses the inherent weakness of monolithic polymers, enabling the creation of high-performance polymer composites. The advantages include cost-effectiveness and the ability to produce complex shapes with precision, as well as potential applications in biomedical, automotive, and aerospace fields. The current state, drawbacks, and future prospects of AM in polymer composite manufacturing are also being explored. AM plays a significant role in advancing material science and engineering by providing innovative solutions for creating complex and high-performance components.
