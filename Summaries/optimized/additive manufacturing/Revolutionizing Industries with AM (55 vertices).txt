Additive manufacturing has revolutionized various industries by enabling the production of complex, customized parts with high precision and efficiency. This technology has found applications in numerous fields, including aerospace, automotive, medical, and dental industries, among others. AM processes, such as laser powder bed fusion, directed energy deposition, material jetting, binder jetting, and sheet lamination, offer advantages like design freedom, resource efficiency, and the ability to manufacture assemblies and devices. The versatility of AM is demonstrated through its ability to work with various materials, including polymers, metals, ceramics, and composites, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. The medical field has particularly benefited from AM, as it allows for the creation of personalized implants, prosthetics, and tissue-engineered constructs. This technology has also been used in the development of bio-printed living tissues and cells, as well as in the production of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. However, challenges remain in AM, such as the need for post-processing to improve part quality, the presence of residual stresses, and the potential for defects. Emerging technologies like hybrid-AM combine AM with other processes to enhance part quality and performance. AM is a rapidly growing field with immense potential.
