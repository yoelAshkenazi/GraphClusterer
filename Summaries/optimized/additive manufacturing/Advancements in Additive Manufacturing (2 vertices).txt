Recent advancements in additive manufacturing have led to the production of advanced materials, focusing on cermets and polymeric composites. AM techniques have been explored to overcome the limitations of conventional production methods for cermets, such as powder metallurgy and casting. Processes like selective laser sintering/melting, laser engineering net shaping, and binder jet 3D printing have been investigated for creating bulk cermet components with combined ceramic and metallic properties. AM has also revolutionized the production of polymer-based structures, offering cost-effectiveness and high precision, but the mechanical properties of monolithic polymers are often inadequate, leading to a focus on developing high-performance printable polymer composites. Several AM methods for polymeric composites, including stereolithography, SLS, fused filament fabrication, fused deposition modeling, and binder jetting, have been developed, each with advantages, limitations, and potential future developments, showcasing the progress and potential of AM in advancing material science and manufacturing.
