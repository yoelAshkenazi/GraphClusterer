Composite materials have various applications in different fields. In dentistry, composites are used as dental filling materials, with a new type aiding in pH neutralization to prevent caries. Textile composite materials used in high-temperature environments are analyzed for their structure, mechanical and thermal properties, and failure criteria. A layered wood-polymer composite material aims to improve energy efficiency in the construction industry by utilizing waste materials and enhancing thermal insulation. The potential of using limestone waste in Portland cement composites to improve crystallization and structure formation is explored, leading to higher-class compositions. Research on the impact of combined fields, such as ultrasound and magnetic fields, on cement compositions demonstrates significant strength increases in hardened cement paste, mortars, and concretes. The fatigue strength of composite materials is investigated, revealing that fatigue fracture is influenced by defect accumulation, with the damage accumulation curve defined by the number of loading cycles and stress level. A method for studying external impacts on composite materials is proposed, utilizing digital micrographs to analyze changes in the material's parameters, which can be applied to recycle plant-based waste and mineral substances for use in furniture and building industries, highlighting the diverse applications and ongoing research in composite materials.
