Composite materials present a wide range of topics from their introduction and various applications to the challenges and opportunities they present, covering unique properties derived from the combination of different constituent materials that can be tailored to meet specific requirements in various fields such as construction, aerospace, and electronics. The synthesis and modeling of composite materials for ballistic applications emphasize understanding the interaction between fiber types, fabric structures, and impact mechanisms. Composite materials can strengthen parametric architecture objects, improving stress-strain states and dynamic characteristics without increasing the weight of the structure. They can also be used in garment production by creating digital models with precise parameters of stress-strain properties. An analytical method can predict building composite materials' characteristics based on their components' properties. Modified polymer composites highlight the advantages of rapid prototyping and expanding 3D-printed objects' applications in various fields, including garment production with precise stress-strain properties. Composite materials are also utilized in the aerospace industry.
