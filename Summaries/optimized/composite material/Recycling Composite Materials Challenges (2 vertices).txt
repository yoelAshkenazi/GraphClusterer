The use of composite materials in various industries, such as automotive and aerospace, is widespread, but their recycling, especially for thermoset-based polymer composites, remains a challenge due to their complex nature. The development of recycling technologies and the improvement of composite materials are crucial to address waste management and environmental concerns. A fatigue damage model for composite materials has been developed, which accounts for stiffness degradation and is validated through experimental data. The model accurately predicts the damage evolution and accumulation in composites under variable loading conditions. Further advancements in recycling technologies and the design of more recyclable composites are needed to meet legislative requirements and promote resource and energy conservation, overcoming barriers such as high recycling costs and limited markets for recyclates, and making composite materials more sustainable and environmentally friendly.
