The use of composite materials is widespread across various industries, offering advantages in automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy applications. However, their recycling, especially for thermoset-based polymer composites, remains a challenge due to their complex nature. With growing environmental concerns and legislation, there is a pressing need to develop efficient recycling methods for these materials to reduce waste and conserve resources. While several technologies have been explored, including mechanical, thermal, and chemical recycling, high costs and market limitations hinder their widespread commercialization. To address this, ongoing research and development focus on creating more recyclable composite materials and improving separation technologies. The fatigue behavior of composites under cyclic loading is another critical aspect, with a proposed fatigue damage model showing promising results in predicting material degradation and lifespan. This model, validated through experimental data, demonstrates the importance of understanding and managing composite material degradation to ensure their long-term performance and reliability. Composite materials pose a dual challenge of harnessing their benefits while addressing their end-of-life management and environmental impact, calling for continued innovation in material design and recycling processes to ensure a sustainable future.
