Biomass-derived carbons and their composites with conductive materials, such as metals, metal sulfides, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide, are used for supercapacitor applications. By incorporating these conductive additives, the internal resistance of biomass-derived carbons is reduced, leading to improved charge/discharge capabilities and increased specific capacitance. The composites also combine the benefits of electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, resulting in higher energy density. Layered double hydroxides, which are synthetic two-dimensional nanostructured materials, are used to form nano-hybrid and nano-composite materials. By intercalating anionic pigments into layered double hydroxides, the interlayer spacing increases, creating a nano-hybrid material that can be used as a filler to create a nano-composite with improved thermal stability. Advanced materials and their composites are used to enhance the performance and stability of energy storage technologies, particularly in the field of supercapacitors and nanocomposites.
