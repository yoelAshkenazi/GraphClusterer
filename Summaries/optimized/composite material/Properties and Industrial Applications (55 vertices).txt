Composite materials and their applications are discussed in terms of properties, production, and impact on various industries. Composites are used in dentistry to treat caries by neutralizing salivary pH and preventing further decay. Textile composites are studied for their mechanical and thermal properties, particularly in high-temperature environments, and their failure criteria are described. Wood-polymer composites are developed as an energy-efficient and cost-effective thermal insulation material for the construction industry, addressing resource depletion and environmental concerns. The introduction of waste materials, such as limestone and plant-based substances, into composite production is explored to enhance properties and promote sustainability. Research on the fatigue strength of composite materials reveals that the accumulation of defects and damage significantly influences their durability. Methods to study external impacts on composites are proposed, analyzing digital micrographs to understand the effects on the material's structure, contributing to improving composite materials' performance, sustainability, and application in various fields, including dentistry, construction, and furniture manufacturing.
