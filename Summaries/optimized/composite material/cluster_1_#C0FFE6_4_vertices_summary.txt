Abstract Composite material for medical application on the basis of polydimethylsiloxane rubber (PDMS) and graphite was obtained. The absence of pores on the surface of the material avoids microbiological fouling and concomitant deterioration of the characteristics with time, and the presence of the mesoporous phase results in a linear calibration and acceptable response times, even for layers that are significant in thickness..
