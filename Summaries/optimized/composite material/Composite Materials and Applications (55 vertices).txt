Composite materials have various applications in different fields. Dental composites are used in dentistry to treat caries, and their popularity stems from their beneficial properties, with ongoing research aimed at improving them, including a new composite that helps prevent dental caries by neutralizing salivary pH. Textile composite materials are used in high-temperature environments and have a six-level structure, with mathematical models analyzing their mechanical and thermal properties, and different types of destruction and corresponding failure criteria. A wood-polymer composite material has been developed for thermal insulation, with a focus on improving operational properties and reducing market value, using thermomodified wood and thermoplastic polymers. The construction industry is focusing on energy-saving building materials, emphasizing the use of secondary products and addressing environmental concerns, with a need for innovative solutions. Limestone waste can improve the properties of cement stone and increase the strength of resulting compositions in Portland cement composites. The combined use of ultrasound and magnetic fields can significantly enhance the strength of hardened cement paste, mortars, and concretes. Developing new materials with unique properties is important to address modern challenges, and fatigue strength is a crucial aspect of composite materials.
