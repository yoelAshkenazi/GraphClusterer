Composite materials and their applications are discussed, highlighting the growing interest in green composite materials that are environmentally friendly and made from recyclable and renewable resources, such as metallic, polymer, and cement-based composites. Green metal-matrix composites and their unique properties are focused on, with aluminum and magnesium composites being prominent examples. Dynamic materials, including vibrational dynamics and kinetic materials that can change their properties under specific conditions like vibration, are also introduced. Viscoelastic principles are applied to constructional composite materials, and the impact of nanoscience on the development of carbon-based nanomaterials, particularly graphene, is discussed for enhancing polymer properties. Analytical models for evaluating residual stresses in polymeric composite materials are reviewed, emphasizing accurate resin behavior modeling. Composite materials also play a role in enhancing the load capacity of railway sleepers to accommodate heavier and faster trains, using analytical and experimental methods for validation.
