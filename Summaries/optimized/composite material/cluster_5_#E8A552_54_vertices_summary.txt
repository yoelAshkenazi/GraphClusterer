The priority research direction involves creation of cement compositions and technologies that meet the requirements of technological availability and efficiency, environmental safety and sustainability, biocompatibility, economic efficacy and energy and resource saving. The paper proves that these criteria can be affected by material and field impacts on cement systems, which leads to considerable increase in strength of hardened cement paste, mortars and concretes..
