Composite materials are being developed and applied to enhance energy storage and performance. Biomass-derived carbons and their composites with conductive materials are being used for supercapacitor applications, with conductive additives like metals, metal sulfides, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide reducing internal resistance and improving charge/discharge capabilities and specific capacitance values. These composites combine the benefits of electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, resulting in enhanced energy density. Layered double hydroxides can host Azo-compounds to form nano-hybrid structures, such as a large anionic pigment intercalated into Zn-Al LDH, increasing interlayer spacing and forming a complex host-guest interaction. This nano-hybrid material can be used as a filler for polyvinyl alcohol to create a nano-composite with improved thermal stability. Composite materials show potential in enhancing the properties of energy storage systems and nanostructures.
