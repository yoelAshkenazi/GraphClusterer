Abstract The modern effective method of reinforced concrete bridge superstructures reinforcement using composite materials is considered. The results of comparative analysis of physical and mechanical properties of materials used to strengthen the bridge spans that have received defects and damage during their operation are presented. The results of the performed analysis of experimental studies of building structures reinforced by similar methods are shown.This chapter focus on the synthesisSynthesis, analysis and modeling of composite materialsComposite materials used in ballistic applicationsBallistic applications.The main components of the compositesComposite including fiberFiber types and fabric structuresFabric structures are described in detail.Then, the ballistic impact mechanisms for textile and composite materialsComposite materials are discussed with failure mechanisms that occurred in the ballistic testsBallistic test. Additionally, numerical simulationNumerical simulation techniques and material models for ballisticBallistics fabrics and compositeComposite structuresStructure are presented with corresponding literature published in the last five years.Finally, final trends such as bio-inspired structuresStructure and adding novel soft energyEnergy absorbing materials into the ballisticBallistics structuresStructure are exemplarily offered.The work is devoted to the study of physical and mechanical processes occurring during the processing of modified and filled etheretherketone, and the development of a composite material with high performance properties..
