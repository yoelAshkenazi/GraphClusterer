Missile defense and related technologies are discussed with a focus on regional security and strategic stability, exploring the development and deployment of missile defense systems, their impact on international relations, and the challenges posed by emerging technologies such as hypersonic weapons. The evolution of missile defense policies in the United States, Russia, and other countries, and their implications for global security are analyzed, including the motivations and strategies behind these policies, such as the U.S. Missile Defense Review, the Russian ASD system, and the NATO missile defense system. The technological development of missile defense systems and their effectiveness in countering various types of missiles are also discussed, including the use of simulation models, statistical tests, and topological scattering patterns to evaluate performance. The role of radar systems, target designation accuracy, and missile guidance in the overall effectiveness of missile defense is explored, as well as the political and military implications of missile defense systems, particularly in the context of regional security, including the potential impact of NATO's theater missile defense on European security and the importance of arms control and transparency regimes in maintaining stability.
