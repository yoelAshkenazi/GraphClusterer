Missile technology, design, and control are discussed with a focus on improving performance, accuracy, and stability. Various topics are covered, including guidance laws, control systems, aerodynamics, and propulsion systems for hypersonic missiles. Advanced control algorithms and techniques, such as back-stepping, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, and Lyapunov theory, are used to ensure stability and accuracy in missile guidance and control, applied to complex and nonlinear missile models, taking into account uncertainties and external disturbances. Aerodynamics and propulsion of hypersonic vehicles are also explored, including variable-geometry dual-mode ramjets and drag reduction strategies, with the impact of high-temperature effects and non-equilibrium chemical reactions on hypersonic flow investigated through numerical simulations validating experimental data. Guidance and control of missiles, including anti-tank and anti-radiation missiles, are discussed using game theory, proportional navigation, and multi-input multi-output systems, emphasizing minimizing miss distances and improving interception capabilities, with various strategies proposed to achieve these goals. Missile defense systems, such as infrared jammers and missile warning systems, are also covered, with their effectiveness in countering threats discussed, along with design and simulation challenges and potential solutions.
