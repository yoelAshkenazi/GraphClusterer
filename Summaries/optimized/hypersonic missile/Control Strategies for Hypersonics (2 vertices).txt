Advanced control strategies for hypersonic vehicles are discussed, focusing on differentiators and fault-tolerant control systems. Finite- and fixed-time higher-order sliding mode differentiators are introduced, offering improved performance compared to traditional Levant recursive methods, and are applied in a hypersonic missile control simulation to handle matched and unmatched disturbances while maintaining high output tracking accuracy. An FTC scheme is proposed for a hypersonic gliding vehicle to address actuator faults and model uncertainties, utilizing a control-oriented model and specially designed observers to estimate faults and uncertainties, ensuring estimation errors converge to zero in a fixed time. The FTC system incorporates finite-time multivariable terminal sliding mode control and composite-loop design, as demonstrated through successful simulation studies on a complex six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear model, emphasizing the importance of rapid and accurate response in challenging environments to enhance the robustness and safety of hypersonic vehicle control systems.
