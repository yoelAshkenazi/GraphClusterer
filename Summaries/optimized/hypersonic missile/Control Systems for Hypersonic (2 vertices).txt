The development and application of advanced control systems for hypersonic vehicles focus on two main aspects: differentiators and fault-tolerant control. Finite- and fixed-settling time differentiators using a higher-order sliding mode observer can estimate convergence/settling times independently of initial conditions. These differentiators are compared to the Levant recursive method in a hypersonic missile control simulation, showcasing their improved performance. The simulation includes a continuous adaptive higher-order sliding mode control with a double-layer adaptive algorithm, ensuring accurate output tracking and robustness against disturbances and uncertainties. An FTC scheme for a hypersonic gliding vehicle addresses actuator faults and model uncertainties by designing observers to estimate faults and uncertainties, guaranteeing estimation errors converge to zero in a fixed time. This FTC system incorporates finite-time multivariable terminal sliding mode control and composite-loop design, ensuring the vehicle's safety post-fault. Simulations on a nonlinear model validate the FTC's effectiveness, highlighting the importance of advanced control strategies in enhancing the performance and reliability of hypersonic vehicles, particularly in challenging flight conditions.
