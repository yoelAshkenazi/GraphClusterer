Iraqi ballistic missile attacks on Iranian cities during the eight-year-long Iraq-Iran war resulted in significant civilian casualties, with Dezful and Tehran experiencing the highest death tolls. Data collected from army reports indicate that Iraq launched 533 ballistic missiles towards Iran, with 414 hitting Iranian cities and causing 2,312 deaths and 11,625 injuries. Tehran endured 118 missile strikes in a span of 52 days, leading to 422 deaths and 1,579 injuries. The high accuracy of modified Scud missiles, which were able to hit crowded areas, was a major factor in the high mortality rates. The analysis highlights the need to investigate the psychological impact on survivors in the affected Iranian cities and emphasizes the importance of preparedness, including warning systems and shelters, to mitigate civilian casualties in future conflicts, and underlines the crucial role of civilian defense forces, rescue services, and medical facilities in responding to mass casualties caused by such attacks.
