Iraqi ballistic missile attacks on Iranian cities during the Iraq-Iran war had a significant impact, with a focus on casualties and patterns of these strikes. Data from military reports reveals that Iraqi forces launched a substantial number of ballistic missiles towards Iranian territories, resulting in considerable civilian casualties. The majority of these missiles targeted urban areas, with Tehran, the Iranian capital, being particularly affected. The high accuracy of modified Scud missiles, capable of hitting crowded areas, was a primary reason for the high mortality rates in cities like Tehran and Dezful. The need to investigate the psychological effects on survivors is emphasized, and the importance of preparedness, including warning systems and shelters, to mitigate civilian casualties in future conflicts is highlighted. The casualties were not limited to a single city, but rather spread across 27 Iranian cities, indicating the widespread impact of these missile attacks.
