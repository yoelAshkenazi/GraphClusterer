Iraqi missile attacks on Iran during the Iraq-Iran war reveal crucial insights into the impact and consequences of these strikes. Over the course of the eight-year conflict, a significant number of ballistic missiles were fired, with a large percentage targeting Iranian cities, resulting in devastating effects on civilian populations, with thousands of casualties reported, including deaths and injuries. Tehran, the Iranian capital, was particularly affected, suffering high mortality rates due to the accuracy of modified Scud missiles hitting crowded areas. The psychological impact on survivors in the targeted cities needs to be investigated, and the implementation of warning systems and shelters could have potentially mitigated civilian losses. Preparedness among civilian defense forces and medical facilities is important to handle mass casualties resulting from such attacks, highlighting the devastating consequences of ballistic missile warfare on civilian populations and the long-term effects it can have on affected communities.
