In order to optimize the geometry of the missileâ€™s crosssection for transportation purposes and also to obtain higher aerodynamic efficiencies, non-circular bodies have gained substantial attention by many researchers.In this work, we have compared the aerodynamic characteristics of two missiles having the same crosssectional areas, but different shapes (one circular and one square with round corners). In order to differentiate the non-circularity and the fin effects, we have considered the bodies with no fins. A threedimensional, compressible, stationary, viscous, turbulent flow has been simulated using the FLUENT CFD code with the standard k-e model. The results have been compared with the existing benchmark data and with the data we obtained using DIGITAL DATCOM and MISSILE DATCOM softwares..
