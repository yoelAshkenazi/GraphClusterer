Scramjet engines, used in hypersonic flight, operate at supersonic speeds with Mach numbers greater than 5 or 6, and their unique design features, such as shock wave compression and fuel injection, enable efficient combustion and thrust generation. Various aspects of scramjet technology are explored, including the challenges of modeling supersonic combustion, the development of computational models, and the optimization of intake and fuel injection systems. Computational modeling of scramjet components emphasizes the reduction of three-dimensional models to one-dimensional representations for efficiency, while leading edge bluntness is shown to improve intake performance, demonstrating improvements in pressure recovery and Mach number. A new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations captures composition fluctuations and is applied to experimental scramjet ground tests. Injector design and fuel mixing play a crucial role in enhancing scramjet performance, with strut fins within the nozzle injector improving fuel mixing when vortex strength is not excessive, and the 3-lobe injector showing higher efficiency. Plasma jets and RF discharges are also explored in scramjet combustion, considering energy coupling and impedance mismatch for various plasma column dimensions.
