Various research and development efforts in the field of scramjet technology are underway, focusing on experimental investigations, computational modeling, and practical applications. Experimental investigations include testing scramjet models in ground facilities, highlighting the importance of piston gasdynamic units and multicascade compression for characterizing scramjet sections under near-flight conditions. Computational modeling of combustion processes in scramjet channels emphasizes the significance of radiative heat flux in the combustor wall. Flame stabilization in solid fuel scramjets is also crucial, requiring proper fuel grain geometry and flame holders. A historical perspective on scramjet development emphasizes the role of three-dimensional computer models. A data-driven approach using convolutional neural networks can predict velocity fields in scramjet isolators based on wall pressure measurements, enhancing the accuracy of velocity field predictions. Modern scramjet development projects face challenges and solutions in high-speed aircraft design. Joint Russian-American flight tests of a dual-mode scramjet aim to achieve flight-to-ground correlation of measured data with preflight analysis and wind tunnel tests. The interaction of cellular detonation waves with supersonic reacting flow in scramjet combustion chambers suggests the potential for using pulsating detonation for ignition intensification.
