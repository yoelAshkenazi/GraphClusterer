The scramjet engine is a cutting-edge technology that has gained significant interest in the field of aerospace engineering, with research focusing on fuel injection strategies, combustion processes, and performance optimization. Achieving efficient mixing between air and fuel is a critical issue, and the cavity flame holder, particularly the cavity rear wall-expansion, is a promising method for enhancing mixing and improving combustor efficiency. Cavity geometry, fuel/air injection location, and dual/double cavity configurations also impact engine performance. Thermal management is crucial, especially in hydrogen-fueled scramjets, and the multi-stage open cooling cycle is an effective method for recovering waste heat and producing power and electricity. The dual-mode scramjet combustor is a promising candidate for hypersonic airplanes, with research progress on flame propagation and stabilization highlighting the influence of operational conditions and geometric parameters on the combustion process. Various mixing augmentation devices, such as wall injection, struts, ramps, cavities, vortex generators, and new configurations, have been developed.
