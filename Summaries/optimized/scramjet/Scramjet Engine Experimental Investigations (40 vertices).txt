Various experimental investigations, computational models, and theoretical analyses related to scramjet engines, a type of air-breathing propulsion system for supersonic flight, are discussed. The development of scramjet technology, the importance of accurate parameter prediction for hypersonic flight, and the challenges associated with supersonic combustion are covered. Experimental testing of scramjet demonstrators, such as the Hyper-X, in ground facilities is used to study their characteristics, with models and full-scale vehicle sections simulating flight conditions. Computational models, like one for a solid-fuel scramjet, take into account geometry variation and obtain typical flow patterns at different combustion stages. Thermodynamic analysis of scramjet combustors compares different schemes, incorporating magnetohydrodynamic devices to improve performance, highlighting the advantages of subsonic mode operation and advanced concepts like the AJAX concept. Experimental investigations of fuel ignition and combustion in scramjet combustors, including kerosene and hydrogen piloting, emphasize flame stabilization, the role of struts in enhancing mixing and combustion, and the challenges of efficient flame stabilization in supersonic combustors.
