Scramjet technology is a type of air-breathing engine designed for hypersonic flight, involving complex physics and chemistry in supersonic combustion within the flowpath. The scramjet's unique design allows for efficient operation at high Mach numbers by minimizing flow deceleration and associated temperature increases. A novel scramjet intake system improves combustion efficiency and reduces pressure losses through optimized fin angles and entrance width. Computational modeling techniques, including a step-by-step approach to creating a scramjet mathematical model, and the use of computational fluid dynamics, simulate different intake designs. A blunt leading edge in the intake ramp improves pressure recovery and Mach number at the isolator exit. A new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations accounts for composition fluctuations and is tested on a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor, capturing the effects of composition fluctuations near the injection point. The role of fuel injection and mixing is explored, with strut fins within the nozzle injector enhancing fuel mixing and improving engine performance, and a 3-lobe injector with an inner fin at a specific height offering optimal performance.
