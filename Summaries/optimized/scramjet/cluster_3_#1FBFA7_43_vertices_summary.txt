Wall cavities have been widely used as flameholders in scramjet engines to prolong the residence time of the fuel and the air in supersonic flow. These devices improve the combustion efficiency of the scramjet combustor, and also impose additional drag on the engine. In this paper, the two-dimensional coupled implicit NS equations, the standard k–ε turbulence model and the finite-rate/eddy-dissipation reaction model have been applied to simulate numerically the combustion flow field of a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor with a cavity flameholder..
