Abstract In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to disclose the impacts of upstream shock waves on fuel mixing of cross coaxial air and fuel jet at a scramjet engine. This study uses CFD simulations to analyze the effects of upstream shock waves on fuel mixing in the transverse coaxial jet and assess their potential for improving combustion efficiency. The results demonstrate that the usage of upstream shock waves significantly increases shock interactions and augments the vortex region downstream of the jet. Our results show that the impacts of shock waves on the penetration of fuel jet released from the coaxial lobe are substantial.Increasing the fuel mixing performance in the combustor of scramjet substantially improves the overall efficiency of the scramjet engine. In this article, computational fluid dynamic is used to study the impacts of hydrogen jets injection through the backward-facing multi-steps on the fuel distribution and mixing zone at the supersonic air stream of Mach = 4. This study also analyzes the jet flow feature and circulation of jets in different sections of the combustor at downstream of the multi-injectors. Reynolds average Navier-Stocks equations are solved with SST turbulence model for achieving a precise and acceptable solution..
