The efficient mixing of fuel and air is a critical challenge in the design of scramjet engines, particularly due to the short residence time of fuel within the combustor. Various fuel injection strategies have been proposed to enhance mixing, with cavity flame holders being a well-organized method for supporting the ignition zone. The cavity rear wall-expansion is an innovative type of cavity flame holder that significantly impacts the efficiency of the scramjet combustor, while micro air jets improve the flame-holding mechanism. Dual cavities also show promise, indicating a feasible preference for future scramjet engine development. The main challenge in scramjet engine technology is thermal management, especially for hydrogen-fueled scramjets. A multi-stage open cooling cycle is proposed as an appropriate solution, with optimization studies showing significant improvements in energy and exergy efficiencies. The dual-mode scramjet combustor is a promising candidate for hypersonic airplanes, and its flame propagation and stabilization process significantly affect performance. The operational conditions and geometric parameters strongly influence the flame stabilization process, making it a multi-objective design optimization problem. Various mixing augmentation devices have been proposed to address the short residence time issue, including wall injection, struts, ramps, cavities, vortex generators, and new configurations developed in China. These devices have been analyzed through numerical and experimental studies, providing insights for the development of large-scale scramjet engines at increased flight Mach numbers.
