The scramjet engine is a promising technology for high-speed flight, but its development faces several challenges. The primary focus is on improving fuel-air mixing efficiency, which is crucial for the engine's performance. Various fuel injection strategies, such as cavity flame holders, struts, and transverse injection techniques, have been proposed to address this issue. Cavity flame holders are an effective method for supporting the ignition zone and enhancing mixing, with the influence of cavity geometry, fuel/air injection location, and dual/double cavity configurations on scramjet combustor performance having been extensively studied. The cavity rear wall-expansion significantly impacts the efficiency of the scramjet combustor, while micro air jets improve the flame-holding mechanism, and dual cavity configurations show potential for future growth. The thermal management of scramjet engines is another critical challenge, especially for hydrogen-fueled scramjets due to their high combustion temperatures, requiring a competent cooling system to recover waste energy and maintain engine performance. The multi-stage open cooling cycle has been proposed as an appropriate choice, with optimization studies showing significant improvements in energy and exergy efficiencies. The dual-mode scramjet combustor, which can operate in both ramjet and scramjet modes, is a promising candidate for combined cycle engines, with the flame propagation and stabilization process in this combustor being critical.
