The development of hypersonic technology, particularly scramjet engines, is a complex and multifaceted field of research and engineering. Various aspects of scramjet engine development are crucial, such as the importance of three-dimensional computer models in understanding scramjet processes, the use of deep learning for velocity field prediction, and the historical overview of scramjet propulsion development. The challenges and solutions in scramjet development are highlighted in the review of modern achievements in high-speed flying vehicles with power plants. Experimental investigations, including the testing of a dual-mode scramjet engine at Mach 6.5, the study of kerosene fuel ignition and combustion stabilization in a two-dimensional scramjet combustor, and the analysis of the frontier in hypersonic flights via air-breathing scramjet, provide valuable insights into the practical challenges and opportunities in scramjet development. Computational simulations, including the use of convolutional neural networks for velocity field prediction, the development of a computational model for a solid-fuel scramjet, and the application of reduced reaction mechanisms for n-decane-hydrogen fuel blends in a model scramjet duct, contribute to the understanding of scramjet combustion and behavior.
