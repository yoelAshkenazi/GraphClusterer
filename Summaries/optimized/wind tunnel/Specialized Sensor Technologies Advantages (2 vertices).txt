Specialized sensor technologies are used for various measurements in wind tunnel experiments. Luminescent sensor paint enables quantitative pressure measurements on aircraft models in wind tunnels, offering advantages such as fast response time, stability, and high accuracy, with variations of less than 2% compared to traditional pressure tap methods. The sensors also provide semi-quantitative pressure measurements in shock wind tunnels at high Mach numbers, providing valuable data. Temperature-Sensitive Paint technology is utilized for studying boundary layer transition on flat plates in short-duration wind tunnels, demonstrating its effectiveness at high Mach and Reynolds numbers in investigating both natural and induced boundary layer transitions. Both technologies enhance the capabilities of wind tunnel testing by providing additional measurement methods and improving the understanding of complex flow phenomena.
