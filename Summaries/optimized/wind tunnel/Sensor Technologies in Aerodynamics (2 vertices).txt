Specialized sensor technologies are used for quantitative and qualitative measurements in wind tunnel experiments, specifically in aircraft modeling and boundary layer analysis. Luminescent sensor paint applied to aircraft models allows for pressure measurements with a fast response time, stability, and high accuracy, even in transonic and shock wind tunnels, using a technique based on oxygen quenching of luminescence. Temperature-Sensitive Paint technology is used to study boundary layer transition on flat plates in short-duration wind tunnels at high Mach and Reynolds numbers, enabling the investigation of both natural and induced boundary layer transitions and providing valuable insights into fluid dynamics. Both methods offer unique advantages in their respective applications, enhancing the understanding of complex aerodynamic phenomena and contributing to more accurate wind tunnel testing.
