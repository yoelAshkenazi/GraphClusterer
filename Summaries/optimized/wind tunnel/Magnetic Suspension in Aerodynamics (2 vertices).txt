Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) have been developed and applied in wind tunnels within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to address specific challenges in aerodynamics, including the measurement of aerodynamic loads and the study of base pressure. The electromagnetic setup, position sensing, and control systems of existing MSBS in CIS wind tunnels provide capabilities such as high-angle-of-attack and roll control, with preliminary experimental results. Meanwhile, research has focused on the physical and mechanical properties of ABS plastics for creating aerodynamic models using additive manufacturing, specifically the FDM technique, to assess their suitability for wind tunnel experiments. Testing ABS plastic samples at different temperatures reveals their structural characteristics and failure modes. These efforts contribute to enhancing the accuracy and range of experiments in aerodynamics research by developing advanced suspension and control systems and investigating material properties for model manufacturing.
