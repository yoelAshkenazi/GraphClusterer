Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) aim to address specific challenges in aerodynamics, including the accurate measurement of aerodynamic loads on aircraft models without interference from mechanical supports and the study of base pressure. MSBS have electromagnetic setups, position sensing mechanisms, and control and calibration systems, and are capable of controlling high-angle-of-attack and roll movements. Preliminary experimental results have been obtained in these areas, as well as in digital control and aerodynamic testing. ABS plastics, used in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) to create aerodynamic models for wind tunnel testing, have been tested at normal and negative temperatures to understand their structural characteristics and failure modes. The suitability of ABS plastic for constructing various models required in wind tunnel experiments has been assessed. Developing advanced technologies and materials for wind tunnel testing is crucial for accurate and reliable data collection in aerodynamics research, and both MSBS and ABS plastic contribute to the advancement of aerodynamic model testing methodologies.
