Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) for wind tunnels are being developed in order to solve the principal problems of aerodynamics which cannot be solved by conventional means: (1) measurements of aerodynamic loads acting on the aircraft models without the effects of mechanical supporting devices; and (2) the study of base pressure..
