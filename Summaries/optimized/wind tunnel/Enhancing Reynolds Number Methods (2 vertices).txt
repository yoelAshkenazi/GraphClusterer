Methods to enhance the Reynolds number in hypersonic wind tunnels are discussed, focusing on different approaches and their effectiveness. Analytical and numerical studies were conducted to evaluate various techniques, considering factors such as real gas effects, stagnation pressures, temperatures, and Mach numbers. The preferred method to increase the Re number is by elevating the stagnation pressure of the test gas, particularly for specific nozzle exit diameters and test durations. The IT-302M hotshot wind tunnel models high-velocity flows with impressive parameters, achieving unique results like positive thrust force in a scramjet model. Pioneering activities include comparing inlet flows in different wind tunnel types and exploring new concepts for short-duration wind tunnels, contributing to advancing the understanding and capabilities of wind tunnel technology in high-speed flow simulations.
