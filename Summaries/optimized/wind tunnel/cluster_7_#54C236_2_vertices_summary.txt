The application of luminescent sensor paint for quantitative pressure measurement on the surface of an aircraft model in wind tunnels is discussed. The main features of this optical sensor are: fast response time (0.005-0.5 s for 99.5% response); thermo-, photo- and mechanical stabilities; homogeneity of properties; low dependence of indicated pressure on temperature (temperature coefficient in the range 0–60 °C is less than 0.3%/°C); and high intensity of luminescence. Results obtained for quantitative pressure-measurement experiments with a sensing surface up to 1 m2 in a transonic wind tunnel (cross section 2.75 m × 2.75 m, T-128 TsAGI wind tunnel) at Mach number 0.4–2 are also discussed..
