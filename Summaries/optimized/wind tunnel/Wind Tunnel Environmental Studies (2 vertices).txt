Two separate studies utilized wind tunnel experiments to investigate environmental factors and their impact on specific natural processes. One study focused on pesticide deposition on windbreak trees and its effect on honey bees, finding that needle-like foliage captures more spray than broad-leaves, and flying bees capture more spray at lower wind speeds compared to bees at rest, with implications for understanding pesticide exposure in honey bees near agricultural areas. Another study examined the wind-driven rain transport process and the effectiveness of BEST sediment traps in capturing sand particles, revealing high integrated efficiencies of the traps at various wind velocities and rain intensities, maintaining their efficiency even under wind-driven rain conditions, crucial for understanding and managing sediment transport in environments exposed to wind and rain. These studies contribute to filling knowledge gaps in their respective fields by providing controlled experimental data, which can be used to improve environmental management practices and protect vulnerable ecosystems.
