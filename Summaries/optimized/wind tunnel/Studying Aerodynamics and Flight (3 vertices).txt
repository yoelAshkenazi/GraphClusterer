Experimental and analytical methods are used to study the aerodynamics and flight dynamics of various objects, including a delta wing, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and an iced cable model of a bridge. A simple analytical model simulates complex dynamics observed in wind tunnel tests for a delta wing, providing a valuable tool for understanding nonlinear aerodynamics. Specialized laboratory setups are needed to study UAV characteristics, emphasizing the importance of controlling airspeed and center of mass position for accurate flight dynamics evaluation. A novel concept for such a laboratory stand offers a unique approach to UAV research. Wind tunnel experiments determine the Strouhal number of an iced cable model, a critical parameter for understanding the aerodynamic behavior of cable-stayed bridges. Combining experimental icing, 3D printing, and numerical photogrammetry, researchers accurately capture the model's shape and conduct aerodynamic tests, showcasing different approaches to understanding aerodynamics, from analytical modeling to specialized laboratory setups and experimental techniques, aimed at improving knowledge of complex aerodynamic phenomena.
