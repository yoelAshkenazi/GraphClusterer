Experimental and analytical methods are used to study the dynamics and aerodynamics of various objects, including a delta wing, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and an iced cable model of a bridge. An analytical model simulates the complex dynamics of a delta wing installed at high incidence in a wind tunnel, helping to validate methods for understanding nonlinear aerodynamics. A novel laboratory stand and methodology research UAV aeromechanics and control, addressing the limitations of traditional wind tunnels in studying modern UAV flight dynamics. Wind tunnel investigations of an iced cable model use advanced techniques like numerical photogrammetry and 3D printing to determine the Strouhal number based on vortex shedding frequency. These studies showcase the application of experimental and mathematical modeling techniques to enhance our understanding of aerodynamics and dynamics, each contributing to the development of more effective research methods in their respective fields.
