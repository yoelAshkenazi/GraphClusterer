Various ways of increasing the Reynolds number, Re, in hypersonic wind tunnels were considered.With results of testing various models for several last years, the article will describe the capabilities of the IT-302M hotshot wind tunnel in terms of modeling of high-velocity flows in the Mach number range from 4 to 20 for external flow regimes and from 2 to 6 for the attached pipeline regime with the following flow parameters: total pressure from 5 to 1000 bar and total temperature from 700 to 3500 K. Some of these pioneering activities are unique: for instance, a positive thrust force was obtained in a scramjet model for the first time; a series of tests was performed for comparisons of the results of inlet flows obtained in hotshot and blow down wind tunnels, including shock starting of the inlet and a possibility of its modeling by using a special device in the long-duration wind tunnel. A new concept of a short-duration wind tunnel with opposing pistons of pressure multipliers has been considered.
