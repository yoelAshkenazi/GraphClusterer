Scientific experiments investigate the behavior and impact of airborne substances under different conditions. Pesticide deposition on windbreak tree species and its potential effect on honey bees is a focus, highlighting the effectiveness of needle-like foliage in capturing more spray compared to broad-leaves, and noting the increased spray capture by flying bees at lower wind speeds. The study aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding the role of biological materials in reducing chemical drift. Wind-driven rain transport and the efficiency of sediment traps in capturing sand particles during the splash-saltation process are also examined, with wind tunnel experiments evaluating the performance of BEST sediment traps at different wind velocities and rain intensities, finding high integrated efficiencies of the traps, even under varying conditions. These studies contribute to a better understanding of how environmental factors influence the behavior and capture of airborne particles, whether pesticides or sand, and how different materials and species interact with these substances.
