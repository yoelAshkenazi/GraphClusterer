Various wind tunnel experiments and their applications are discussed. One focus is on starting processes in a vacuum wind tunnel for studying supersonic flows, highlighting the potential of using simpler setups for certain Mach numbers. A digital Mach number regulator is proposed for a specific wind tunnel type, and its development and testing process is presented. An algorithm for calculating flow parameters in hypersonic wind tunnels is described, considering real gas properties, and validated through experimental measurements. Aeration modeling in quarries is also explored, using a wind tunnel to study air currents and evaluate guiding device effectiveness, with details on the wind tunnel design and modeling technique. The color shadow method is introduced for investigating non-stationary gas-dynamic processes in wind tunnels, showcasing its potential for studying complex gas flow patterns and interactions using specific devices. Overall, different wind tunnel-related studies are explored, including supersonic flow analysis, Mach number regulation, hypersonic flow parameter calculation, aeration modeling, and non-stationary gas-dynamic process investigation, each with its own unique experimental setups and objectives.
