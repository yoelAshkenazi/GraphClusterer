Wind tunnels and wind engineering are explored in various applications and methodologies. One study investigates wind speed and sediment flux profiles in different vegetation settings, both in a wind tunnel and a field-scale windbreak, finding similarities in profile structures across different plant morphologies and densities. Another study focuses on heat convection and transfer in cold-region railway tunnels, developing a computer model to predict temperature fields and emphasizing the importance of considering mechanical ventilation and train-induced winds in engineering designs. The safety of high-speed trains is a recurring theme, with one study examining the impact of a wind barrier on aerodynamic coefficients and flow field structure in a bridge-tunnel section, aiming to improve train safety. A machine learning approach, specifically GANs, is proposed to predict wind pressure coefficients on buildings, which can reduce the need for extensive wind tunnel tests. Wind energy harvesting in high-speed railway tunnels is also discussed, presenting a portable system integrated with S-rotor and H-rotor to power monitoring sensors. A numerical simulation investigates the effect of strong environmental wind on tunnel fires under natural ventilation, providing insights for fire protection design. A strategy is introduced to prevent ballast flying in high-speed railway tunnels by designing the track surface with a specific group of ballasts, addressing a critical safety concern.
