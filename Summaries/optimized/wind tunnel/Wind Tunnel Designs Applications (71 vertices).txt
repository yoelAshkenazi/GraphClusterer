Various wind tunnel designs, testing methods, and applications in the field of aerodynamics and wind energy are discussed. Novel wind tunnel structures are proposed, such as a conical and elevated wind tunnel for power generation, a wind dam concept utilizing natural barriers for wind energy production, and a multipurpose wind tunnel with adjustable test sections for environmental, subsonic, or climatic testing, aiming to improve performance, reduce costs, and enable more versatile experiments. The use of 3D printing technology in wind tunnel model fabrication is explored for its potential to reduce costs and time compared to traditional metal models, with assessments of aerodynamic performance and investigations into suitable materials and printing techniques. Optimizing wind tunnel performance for specific applications is also a focus, including using cryogenic nitrogen as a working gas, implementing automatic control systems for converging-diverging nozzles, and employing genetic algorithms to optimize diffuser shapes, as well as examining the effects of wind tunnel geometry on power generation and flow characteristics. A wide range of wind tunnel experiments are covered, from aerodynamic testing of aircraft models and wind turbine blades to studies of laminar-to-turbulent transition and the effects of trip wires on turbulence intensity, with discussions on the use of different materials and rapid prototyping techniques in model construction and testing.
