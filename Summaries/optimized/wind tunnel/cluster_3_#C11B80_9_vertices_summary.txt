At present experimental gas-dynamic studies of supersonic flows mainly use complex experimental facilities, such as aerodynamic wind tunnels and shock tubes. However, in order to study supersonic flows with Mach numbers M < 4, a vacuum wind tunnel (which is much simpler) can also be used.The airflow control system for subsonic regimes for supersonic periodical wind tunnel (WT) supposed.. The simulation was carried out in a wind tunnel, which makes it possible to study the aerodynamics of air currents in the goaf and evaluate the effectiveness of the use of the guiding device. The results of the experimental measurements of the flow velocity at the contoured nozzle exit in the hypersonic wind tunnel IT-302M have been carried out for verification of the algorithm.The article examines the issues of aeration modelling (organized natural air exchange) in quarries using guiding devices.
