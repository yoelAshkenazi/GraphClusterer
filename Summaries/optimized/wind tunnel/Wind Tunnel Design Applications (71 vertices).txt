Various aspects of wind tunnel design, testing, and applications are explored, covering a wide range of topics from energy production to aerodynamics and engineering. A novel wind tunnel design with a conical and elevation structure is introduced, demonstrating its potential for power generation, and its performance is compared to a straight conical structure using numerical simulations and real-world wind data from Medina, Saudi Arabia. The concept of a "wind dam" is also investigated, utilizing natural barriers to generate high-speed wind zones for wind turbines, and the effects of geometrical parameters on airflow patterns are examined. Additionally, the use of 3D printing technology in wind tunnel model construction is discussed, comparing the aerodynamic performances of 3D printed models with traditional metal models. A multipurpose wind tunnel design that can be adjusted for environmental, subsonic, or climatic testing is also introduced, describing a new design approach that allows for the adjustment of the wind tunnel cycle to achieve different testing conditions.
