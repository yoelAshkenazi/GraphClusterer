A wind tunnel study was conducted to determine pesticide deposition on commonly used windbreak tree species used as spray drift barriers and associated exposure of honey bees. Although it has been known that windbreaks are effective in reducing chemical drift from agricultural applications, there is still an enormous information and data gap on details of the dependence of the mechanism on the biological materials of the barriers and on standardization of relevant assessment methods..
