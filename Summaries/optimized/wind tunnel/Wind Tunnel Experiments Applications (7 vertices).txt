Various aspects of wind tunnel experiments and their applications are discussed. The use of vacuum wind tunnels for studying supersonic flows is introduced, focusing on starting processes. A digital Mach number regulator for a specific type of supersonic wind tunnel has been developed and tested to control airflow and Mach number during subsonic regimes. An algorithm for calculating flow parameters in hypersonic wind tunnels, considering real gas properties, has been presented and validated through experimental measurements. Aeration modelling in quarries has been studied using a closed-circuit wind tunnel to evaluate the effectiveness of guiding devices. Artificial intelligence has been integrated in wind tunnel testing, with different models proposed and hardware implementation and efficiency evaluation discussed. The color shadow method, a technique for investigating non-stationary gasdynamic processes in wind tunnels, has been described, showcasing its potential for studying complex gas flow patterns and interactions.
