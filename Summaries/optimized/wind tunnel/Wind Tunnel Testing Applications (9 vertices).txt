Wind tunnel testing and simulation have various applications in understanding and predicting wind-related phenomena in different contexts. The study of wind speed and sediment flux profiles in different vegetation types reveals that profile structures are similar across plant types and environments, although certain differences exist, such as deflection in wind-tunnel vegetation and uniformity in multi-row windbreaks. A computer model for studying heat convection and transfer in cold-region railway tunnels emphasizes the impact of mechanical ventilation and train-induced winds on temperature distribution. Crosswinds affect high-speed trains in bridge-tunnel sections, and wind barriers can mitigate safety risks. A machine learning approach can predict wind pressure coefficients on buildings, offering a cost-effective alternative to extensive wind tunnel testing. Renewable wind energy harvesting systems can power monitoring sensors alongside high-speed railway tunnels, presenting a promising solution for remote areas with limited electricity supply. Tunnel fires under natural ventilation are studied using numerical simulations to investigate the impact of environmental wind on smoke movement and temperature distribution. A novel approach to prevent ballast flying in high-speed railway tunnels involves designing track surfaces with specific ballast characteristics. A numerical simulation of chemically nonequilibrium air plasma in a high-enthalpy wind tunnel is also presented.
