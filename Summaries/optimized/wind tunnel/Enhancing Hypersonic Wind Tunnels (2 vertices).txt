Enhancing the Reynolds number in hypersonic wind tunnels is achieved by exploring various methods. Analytical and numerical studies evaluate different approaches to increase the Re number, considering real gas effects, stagnation pressures, temperatures, and Mach numbers, concluding that increasing stagnation pressure is the preferred method for specific nozzle exit diameters and test durations. The IT-302M hotshot wind tunnel can model high-velocity flows with Mach numbers ranging from 4 to 20 for external flows and 2 to 6 for attached pipeline flows, with achievements including obtaining positive thrust force in a scramjet model and comparing inlet flow results between different wind tunnel types. A short-duration wind tunnel with opposing pistons is also introduced, emphasizing the importance of specific parameters and methods to improve wind tunnel performance and modeling of high-speed flows.
