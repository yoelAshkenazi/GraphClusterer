The enhancement of hypersonic wind tunnel capabilities and the evaluation of methods to increase the Reynolds number are discussed, with analytical and numerical studies considering real gas effects, stagnation pressures, temperatures, and Mach numbers to optimize the Reynolds number. Increasing stagnation pressure is the preferred method for enhancing the Reynolds number, especially for specific nozzle exit diameters and test durations. The IT-302M hotshot wind tunnel can model high-velocity flows for a wide range of Mach numbers and flow parameters, with achievements including generating positive thrust in a scramjet model and comparing inlet flow results between different wind tunnel types. A short-duration wind tunnel with opposing pistons for pressure multiplication is also introduced, emphasizing advancements in wind tunnel technology and their applications in studying high-speed aerodynamics, focusing on different aspects of improving experimental capabilities.
