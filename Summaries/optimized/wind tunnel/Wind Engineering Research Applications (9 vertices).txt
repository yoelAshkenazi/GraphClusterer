Wind and its interaction with various structures, such as vegetation, tunnels, buildings, and trains, are explored in studies that investigate wind speed and sediment flux profiles in different vegetation types, revealing common profile structures across various plant morphologies and wind velocities. A computer model analyzes heat convection and transfer in a cold-region railway tunnel, predicting the frozen length at the tunnel entrance and emphasizing the significance of considering mechanical ventilation and train-induced winds in tunnel design. A computational fluid dynamics model studies the impact of a wind barrier on train safety under crosswind conditions, finding that it reduces the sharp change in aerodynamic coefficients and improves train safety. Machine learning applications in wind engineering include predicting wind-induced pressures on high-rise building surfaces and wind pressure coefficients on buildings in limited wind tunnel tests, demonstrating the potential to reduce experiment costs. A portable renewable wind energy harvesting system is also introduced for powering.
