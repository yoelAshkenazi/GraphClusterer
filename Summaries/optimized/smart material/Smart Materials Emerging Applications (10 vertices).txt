Smart materials are being developed for various applications across different fields. In the medical field, smart biomaterials are being developed for hard tissue repair and regeneration, offering promising solutions for bone and tooth structures. These materials can respond to stimuli, guide stem cells, and release drugs in a controlled manner. Smart materials are also being utilized in 4D printing technology, where magnetically controlled smart materials enable remote manipulation and wireless control of printed structures, particularly in harsh or complex environments. This technology is still in its early stages and requires further research. Smart materials are making an impact in the food industry through active and smart biodegradable packaging materials, enhancing food safety and quality by incorporating antimicrobials, antioxidants, and sensors that indicate changes in food attributes. Research is ongoing to address challenges and explore future directions for these eco-friendly packaging solutions. In the energy sector, Self-passivating Metal Alloys with Reduced Thermo-oxidation are being developed for fusion power plants, aiming to suppress oxidation and improve plasma performance. The use of smart materials in textiles and wearable electronics is another area of interest, with electrospun smart fibers that can sense and interact with the environment, offering potential applications in healthcare monitoring and energy storage.
