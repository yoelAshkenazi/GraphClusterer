The energy transition, driven by social, environmental, economic, and geopolitical factors, is leading to a significant shift in the production system, particularly in the energy and chemistry sectors, moving away from fossil fuels and traditional refinery and petrochemistry processes towards renewable energy sources and new production methods. Catalysis plays a crucial role in this transition, enabling the conversion of renewable energy sources into usable forms, with the challenge lying in redesigning catalysts to operate under different conditions and for new targets, such as using photons and electrons instead of heat to drive catalytic reactions. This shift from thermal to photo/electrocatalysis requires a rethinking of catalyst design, leading to the development of smart catalytic materials, which are catalysts that can be controlled by external stimuli, allowing for dynamic response and self-regeneration, classified into two main categories: intelligent catalysts with self-regenerative functionalities and catalysts based on the concept of "soft matter in catalysis," where noncovalent bonds play a key role. Smart materials have various applications, including in the construction of smart windows for energy-efficient buildings, which can adjust their solar radiation properties in response to temperature, leading to lower energy consumption, and in healthcare.
