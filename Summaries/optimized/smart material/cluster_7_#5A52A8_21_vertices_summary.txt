This paper reviews the research results, characteristics, modeling and recent developments of smart materials specially shape memory alloys and smart composites. It is considered that the technological impact on human life is undeniable but, as well as making use of the technology environment, consideration is really required. Therefore, this study explores the role of smart structures and materials to create new buildings with sustainable architecture. First, such terms as green architecture and sustainable architecture are identified. Then, using smart technology in buildings and what it would be like, are defined. The purpose of this paper is showing the current research coordinate..
