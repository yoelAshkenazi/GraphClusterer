“Additive manufacturing (AM)” or “rapid prototyping” or often alias as “3DP)” is a flourishing technology that has created a vast space in manufacturing industries. Its application zones cover several areas, including the biomedical, aerospace, military, and automotive industries. In this regard, a particular emphasis is dedicated to the latest progress in the innovation and development of stimuli-responsive materials that are activated and respond over time to physical, chemical, and biological stimuli and their exploitation through 3D printing methods to fabrication 4D printing smart parts such as intelligent tissue-engineered scaffolds, smart orthopedic implants, and targeted drug delivery systems..
