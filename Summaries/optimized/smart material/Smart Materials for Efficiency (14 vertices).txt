Smart materials are responsive to external stimuli, such as temperature, light, and pressure, and can adapt their properties accordingly. They are crucial for developing advanced catalysts that can utilize renewable energy sources efficiently, and are essential for energy transition, particularly those based on solid catalytic materials that can be controlled by artificial intelligence and have self-regenerative functionalities. Smart materials are used in facade technologies and window systems to improve energy efficiency, such as electrochromic, thermochromic, and photochromic windows that can regulate solar radiation gain and reduce energy consumption. They also have applications in healthcare, where they can be used in implantable and wearable devices for diagnostic, therapeutic, and treatment purposes, and can harvest biomechanical energy from human motions or body heat. Additionally, smart materials are used in water treatment, specifically smart membranes.
