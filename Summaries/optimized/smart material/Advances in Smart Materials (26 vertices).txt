The field of smart materials has seen significant advancements in recent years, with a focus on materials that can sense and respond to various stimuli, leading to numerous applications in diverse sectors. Smart materials are engineered to exhibit specific properties when exposed to external stimuli such as temperature, light, electricity, and mechanical forces. Cellulose-based smart materials offer advantages in drug delivery systems, hydrogels, and sensors due to their responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Smart polymeric materials with micro-/nano-structures can be designed to achieve specific functions like shape memory and self-healing. Printing technologies, including inkjet and 3D printing, have been utilized to create intelligent micro/nano devices from smart materials, enabling the development of wearable sensors, integrated optoelectronics, and artificial neurons. Smart wound dressings and drug delivery systems have been developed to respond to specific triggers, providing controlled drug release and enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Smart textiles and fibers have been engineered to integrate phase change materials (PCMs) for energy conversion/storage and temperature regulation, offering exciting possibilities for wearable devices and protective systems. Challenges and future directions in the field emphasize the need for continued innovation and development.
