Smart materials, a class of substances that can alter their properties in response to external stimuli, have diverse applications and principles. They exhibit cooperative behavior and similarity to biological systems, and understanding the physical-chemical principles behind their operation is crucial. Smart materials are used in vibration isolation platforms, construction, and automotive industries, enabling real-time monitoring of changes. Fiber-optic sensors have potential in smart materials, but implementing them is challenging due to the fragility of optical fibers. The advantages of smart materials include being lightweight, flexible, and having low production cost, with electroactive polymers and biopolymers being promising electroactive materials. Two-dimensional smart materials and devices for glazing need improvements in color neutrality, switching rate, and durability. Laser processing is a crucial tool for enhancing smart materials, enabling precise modifications and customization, and is key to the development of 4D printing, which has applications in aerospace, robotics, healthcare, and automotive industries. Understanding the activation mechanisms of smart materials, especially in shape memory polymers, and the role of external stimuli like heat and chemicals is also important.
