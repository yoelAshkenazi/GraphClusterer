Smart materials are substances that can alter their properties in response to external stimuli, offering advantages such as lightweight construction, sensing capabilities, and design flexibility, which can revolutionize various fields. A wide range of smart materials and their applications exist, including shape-memory alloys and piezoelectricity in transportation, smart materials in construction, electronics, and medical devices, electro-responsive materials for smart constructions, photosensitive peptide hydrogels for biomedical applications, and thermochromic materials for thermal radiation regulation. Graphene, a highly conductive and flexible material, also shows potential in touchscreen technology, offering advantages over traditional materials like ITO. While smart materials offer numerous benefits, challenges and considerations such as system compatibility, cost, and environmental sustainability must be addressed, emphasizing the need for further research and development to overcome these challenges and maximize their potential, and highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate smart materials for specific applications, considering factors like climate and user comfort.
