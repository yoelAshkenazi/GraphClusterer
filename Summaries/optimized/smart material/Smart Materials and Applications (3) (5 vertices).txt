4D printing technology and its applications in various fields are explored, particularly focusing on smart materials and structures. 4D-printed smart materials and structures are engineered to respond to external stimuli without computerized control. Applications of 4D printing in medical engineering include the use of smart materials and 3D printing to create dynamic structures with stimuli-responsive properties, with potential in medical implants, tissue engineering, and drug delivery systems. 2D materials play a role in flexible electronics manufacturing, with applications in batteries, micro-supercapacitors, sensors, and potential integration into soft robotics. 3D and 4D printing of mechanical metamaterials, which are functional materials with exceptional mechanical properties, also hold promise, with various manufacturing techniques, structures, and applications, as well as future prospects and challenges. A novel smart electromagnetic interference shielding material can be switched on and off, allowing control over EM wave transmission and shielding, created by combining conductive carbon nanoparticles with a wood-derived aerogel, demonstrating the potential for advanced smart EM devices.
