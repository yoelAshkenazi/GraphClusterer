Abstract An overview is given of the properties of two-dimensional smart photo-, thermo-, and electrochromic materials and devices used for the glazing of buildings and vehicles. It is shown that despite some commercial successes in the creation of materials and devices, further efforts are needed to improve their color neutrality, switching rate, bleached/colored contrast, and durability.This paper describes development of an interdisciplinary “Smart Materials” module in English for Master’s students in a Russian chemical engineering university. The research stage of project implementation included comparative analysis of international engineering education in Germany and Russia in a form of survey included 30 faculty members and 100 students. The visits to universities in four different regions of Germany allowed for planning the structure of the module and the content of lectures and practicums. The survey results contributed to the implementation of the second stage of the project that was focused on developing three disciplines for the module: “Introduction to smart Materials”, “Research Methods for Smart Materials” as lecture courses and “Practical Course in Smart Materials” as the laboratory practicum..
