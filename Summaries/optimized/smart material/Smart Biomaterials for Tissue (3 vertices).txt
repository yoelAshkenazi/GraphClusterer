The field of smart biomaterials is evolving, particularly in the context of hard tissue restoration and articular cartilage repair. Smart biomaterials are defined by their level of interaction with the biological environment and the cellular responses they trigger, ranging from inert to autonomous. They offer a promising approach to addressing the challenges of tissue repair and regeneration due to their ability to regulate cell behavior and provide a suitable microenvironment, achieved through controlled drug/bioactive factor release, mimicking native tissue structures, and responding to various stimuli. Strontium-aluminate-based mechanoluminescent materials are gaining attention for their unique properties, including low force threshold, efficient luminescence, and potential applications in strain sensing and health monitoring. Smart biomaterials have diverse applications, and research is needed to overcome challenges in clinical translation, particularly in tissue engineering for articular cartilage repair, where smart drug release systems and scaffolds are making significant contributions.
