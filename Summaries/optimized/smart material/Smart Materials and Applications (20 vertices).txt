Smart materials, which can alter their properties in response to external stimuli, have the potential to revolutionize various fields due to their lightweight, sensing capabilities, and design flexibility. These materials have applications in construction, where they can adapt to the environment and improve building design and lifespan, such as in sustainable buildings that enhance environmental adaptability and reduce energy consumption. Smart epoxy composites have shape memory and self-healing properties, which are useful in electronics and wind turbines. Smart materials are also used in electronic devices, water treatment, architecture, and sportswear, including graphene-based smart touchscreens and smart textiles that provide comfort and protection. Additionally, smart stents are being developed for medical purposes and smart surfaces for oil/water separation. However, challenges such as system compatibility, cost, and ethical considerations need to be addressed through sustainable development and social discussion. Recent advancements and future prospects in smart materials research highlight their growing importance in various sectors.
