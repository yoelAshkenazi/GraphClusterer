Smart materials and technologies are explored in various aspects, including principles, applications, and development, covering a wide range of topics such as physical-chemical principles, digital technologies in experimental studies and production, and "smart" spaces in construction. Smart magnetorheological elastomers are discussed for use in vibration isolation platforms, highlighting their ability to change properties under external magnetic fields. Smart windows with grating optical chromogenic filters offer improved daylight comfort compared to conventional smart windows. The development of smart-constructions enables real-time monitoring, emphasizing the use of fiber-optic sensors in polymer composite materials, and the challenges and solutions related to protecting these sensors within a Smart-layer are examined. Smart materials, such as shape memory polymers and electroactive polymers, can change their shape, mechanical responses, and other properties under external stimuli, and laser processing enhances smart materials, enabling precise modifications and adaptive properties. A "Smart Materials" module for Master's students promotes English proficiency and attracts foreign students, including courses on smart materials, research methods, and practical applications.
