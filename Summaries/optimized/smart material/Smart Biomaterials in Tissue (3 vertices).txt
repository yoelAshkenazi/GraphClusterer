The development and application of smart biomaterials in various fields, particularly in tissue repair and regeneration, is a growing area of interest. The concept of smart biomaterials is being redefined to include different degrees of smartness based on their interaction with the biological environment and the responses they trigger. Smart biomaterials are being utilized for their ability to respond to stimuli and regulate cellular behavior, providing a favorable environment for tissue repair, achieved through controlled release of drugs or bioactive factors, mimicking native tissue structure, and delivering signaling factors. Smart biomaterials have potential in overcoming the challenges associated with cartilage's limited regenerative capacity, particularly in articular cartilage repair, through smart drug release systems and smart scaffolds. Mechanoluminescence, a phenomenon where mechanical force generates light energy, has applications in sensing and monitoring, with strontium-aluminate-based materials offering low force threshold, efficient luminescence, and potential uses in energy-saving technologies and smart devices.
