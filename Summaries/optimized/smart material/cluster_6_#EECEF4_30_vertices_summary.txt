Abstract With the vigorous development of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, the active sensing system based on triboelectric nanogenerators plays an excellent performance potential and application value as a pioneering technology for smart manufacturing. Nevertheless, achieving material innovation to strike a good balance between active sensing systems and environmental friendliness remains a difficult task. As the most abundant biopolymer on earth, the sustainability potential and excellent performance of cellulose are of great importance for the development of smart sensing systems. This review aims to present the developments of "smart" materials based on cellulose in the last decade, including the preparations, properties, and applications of these materials. The final aim of this study is to add a fundamental block to the electrical characterization of printed conductive polymers, which are promising to mimic the electrical performance of metals and semiconductors..
