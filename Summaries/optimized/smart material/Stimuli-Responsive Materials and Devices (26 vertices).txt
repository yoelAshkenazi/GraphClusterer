The field of smart materials has seen significant advancements, with a focus on stimuli-responsive materials that can adapt to various environmental conditions. These materials are designed to sense and respond to stimuli such as optical, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, and chemical signals, making them valuable in numerous applications. Patterning of smart materials is crucial for creating large-scale arrays of functional devices, with printing methods including inkjet, template-assisted, and 3D printing being extensively explored to fabricate intelligent micro/nano devices. Smart materials are being engineered with various stimuli-responsive capabilities, such as pH, temperature, light, and magnetic field sensitivity, achieved through chemical modifications and physical incorporating/blending techniques. The design of smart polymeric materials with micro-/nano-structures and molecular design is highlighted, emphasizing the interplay between their structures and responsive properties, with applications in drug delivery systems, hydrogels, electronic active papers, sensors, shape memory materials, and smart membranes.
