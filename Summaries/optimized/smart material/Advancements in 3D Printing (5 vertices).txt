Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has revolutionized various industries, and its recent advancements in smart materials and 4D printing have opened up exciting possibilities. This technology enables the creation of complex structures and smart materials that respond to external stimuli, such as heat, light, and pH, allowing for dynamic and adaptable products. 4D printing introduces time as the fourth dimension, where printed objects can change their form over time, making it particularly useful for creating smart devices, textiles, and medical applications. The biomedical field uses 3D printing to fabricate objects for sensor development, gas filtration, and fluid flow control, showcasing its precision and versatility. Smart materials can be used for targeted drug delivery and personalized therapeutics, and the technology is already being utilized in the creation of bioadhesive devices and micro-robots for chemotherapy delivery. 4D printing technology has applications in engineering and biomedical fields, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and smart sutures. Smart textiles can transform their structure and color over time, opening up new possibilities for the fashion industry. The transition from 3D to 4D printing involves the use of smart materials and the application of external stimuli to create dynamic structures, gaining popularity due to its ability to produce functional and intelligent products.
