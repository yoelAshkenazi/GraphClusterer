Smart materials, a broad category of substances that respond to external stimuli by altering their properties, are pivotal in various industries, including construction, automotive, aerospace, and photonics. The physical-chemical principles underpinning smart materials emphasize their cooperative systems and non-additivity. Digital technologies play a significant role in smart materials research, enabling precise control and customization, with laser processing allowing meticulous changes in material properties, fostering innovation in sectors like aerospace, robotics, and healthcare. Smart materials' versatility is exemplified by polymer-based variants, which can change shape, mechanical responses, and light transmission under external stimuli. The development of smart materials is an active area of research, with new approaches being explored, such as the use of nanoparticles and chromogenic materials in smart windows for optimized daylight and solar energy management. Education in this field is also important, with a focus on interdisciplinary modules promoting English proficiency and attracting international students, reflecting the global interest in smart materials research and development, and highlighting their potential to revolutionize various industries and improve human life.
