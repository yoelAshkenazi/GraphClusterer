Smart materials, which can respond to external stimuli such as temperature, light, and pressure, and adapt their properties accordingly, have various applications in fields including energy transition, chemistry, building materials, and healthcare. In the energy sector, smart materials are being used to develop catalysts for renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which can be controlled by artificial intelligence to optimize energy production. The use of smart materials in energy transition aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy production efficiency. Smart materials are also being utilized in building materials to create thermochromic and electrochromic windows, which can regulate the amount of light and heat entering a building, reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency. In healthcare, smart materials are being explored for their potential in creating self-healing materials and implantable devices that can respond to changes in the body, such as temperature and pH, and adapt their properties to provide better treatment and monitoring. Additionally, smart materials are being used in energy storage and conversion devices, such as batteries and fuel cells, to create more efficient and responsive energy systems. Challenges and opportunities associated with smart materials include the need for robust and stable materials, the potential for industrialization, and the importance of understanding their fundamental mechanisms.
