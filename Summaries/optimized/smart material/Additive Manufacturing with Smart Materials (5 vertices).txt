Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has gained significant attention for its ability to create complex structures and its applications across various industries, including biomedical, aerospace, and automotive. The concept of 4D printing takes this a step further by incorporating smart materials that respond to external stimuli, such as heat, light, or pH, allowing printed objects to change shape over time. This technology is particularly relevant in the pharmaceutical industry, where smart materials are already being used for targeted drug delivery and pH-responsive devices. The process involves using multi-material 3D printers to create dynamic structures from shape-memory materials. 4D printing has become increasingly popular in various fields, especially engineering and biomedicine, where it enables the creation of smart devices, actuators, and even textiles. The potential of 3D and 4D printing in textile, apparel, and fashion industries is also highlighted, with recent advancements in creating flexible and functional smart textiles. Specific techniques like screen and ink-jet printing are used, and the transition from 3D to 4D printing includes material selection considerations. Additive manufacturing is on the cusp of revolutionizing various industries by combining the precision of 3D printing with the responsiveness of smart materials.
