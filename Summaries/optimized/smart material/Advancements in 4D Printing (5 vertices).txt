Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has seen rapid advancements and is now exploring the concept of 4D printing, where time is considered the fourth dimension. This technology involves printing objects that can transform their shape or structure over time when exposed to external stimuli like heat, light, or pH changes. 4D printing uses smart materials, such as shape memory alloys and polymers, which can respond to specific stimuli. This capability has led to the creation of devices like bioadhesives and micro-robots for medical purposes. The technology is finding applications in various industries, including the pharmaceutical field, engineering, biomedical fields, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the production of smart devices and textiles. It has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing, creating complex structures and producing functional and flexible textiles through techniques like screen and ink-jet printing. The transition from 3D to 4D printing presents potential applications and future prospects, particularly in the context of smart textiles and fashion.
