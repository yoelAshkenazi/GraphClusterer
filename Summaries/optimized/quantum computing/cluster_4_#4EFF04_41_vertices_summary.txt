We consider a quantum hash function that maps elements of a finite field into quantum states.We consider two complexity measures for Quantum Branching Programs (QBP): a number of qubits and a number of compu-tational steps. We show that the quantum hash function can be computed efficiently. Moreover, we prove that such QBP construction is optimal.This paper describes the basics of performance, as well as the structural and functional component of the development and implementation of the quantum computer simulator. In accordance with this, the computational structure of the quantum computer simulator has been derived, taking into account all the available features of constructing a simulator of a quantum computing device. Also, a software implementation of the derived universal computational structure of such simulator that satisfies and operates according to the principles of this scheme is implemented.The use of quantum computing in graph community detection and regularity checking related to Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma (SRL) are demonstrated with D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer and simulations..
