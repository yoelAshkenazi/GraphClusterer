One of the main objectives of the RZD "Russian Railways" is the research and implementation of quantum telecommunications as the basis for building promising network services. By focusing on improving solutions in the field of automation of railway transport process management, and taking into account the over-growing and changing needs of customers, RZD also wants to trans-form to digitalization and use quantum computing to create flexible management models, optimization of the structure and decision-making processes and the use of quantum computers both in information systems and in technical control systems. The study first identifies areas where the development of information technologies in railway transport is a must. Then the strategies and programs to digitalis these fields are discussed, how they are implemented is shown and finally a comparison is then made with other experiences from different agencies around the world. The Study concludes that the creation of quantum information systems with a contactless neuro-computer interface will solve several problems like the performance of duties by railway personnel, monitoring of significant objects of critical information and technical infrastructure, and public services..
