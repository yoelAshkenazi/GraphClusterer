Quantum computing encompasses various models, algorithms, and practical applications, with the quantum circuit model being the most commonly used due to its ability to implement any quantum algorithm through universal quantum logic gates. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach to address current quantum device constraints and achieve quantum advantage. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and error mitigation techniques are also crucial for near-term quantum devices. Research has shifted from hardware to software, impacting fields like quantum image processing and machine learning. Implementing quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices poses challenges and opportunities, with the goal of discovering useful tasks and applications. Quantum computing's current state and future prospects include theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and the interplay between software and hardware in supporting quantum algorithm design and execution.
