Quantum computing is an emerging technology that uses atoms as digital bits, marking a new era in computer design. Quantum mechanics, with its principles of superposition and entanglement, is the foundation for quantum computers' superior problem-solving capabilities. Practical implementations include the one-way quantum computation model and simulators like OWQS and GOWQS, which efficiently simulate quantum computations. Quantum computers can process all possible states simultaneously, unlike classical computers. Qubits play a crucial role in quantum computers, with leading models including superconducting, ion trap, and neutral-atom qubits. Quantum correlation and discord can be quantified using specific measures. Ternary quantum circuits have been designed, and a quantum reversible ternary half-subtractor circuit has been realized, showcasing the potential of quantum computing in various computational tasks.
