Recent developments in quantum computing have brought the field closer to achieving quantum supremacy, with significant progress in both hardware and software. One approach involves utilizing projected entangled-pair states to simulate quantum algorithms, providing insights into the complexity, memory usage, and time requirements of quantum circuits. This method was successfully demonstrated on a supercomputer for a specific lattice of qubits. The construction of large-scale quantum computers, especially those based on superconducting qubits, has been a major focus, with the 2019 achievement of quantum supremacy using 53 superconducting qubits as a notable milestone. The challenge of implementing high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of noise is addressed by exploring geometric phases, specifically quantum holonomies, which offer noise-tolerant and universal quantum computation capabilities. A proposed method involves using transitionless driving techniques to speed up adiabatic holonomic gates, potentially paving the way for more practical quantum computers. This approach demonstrates the potential of all-geometric quantum computing, where the holonomies approach those of the adiabatic method, ensuring robustness and computational power.
