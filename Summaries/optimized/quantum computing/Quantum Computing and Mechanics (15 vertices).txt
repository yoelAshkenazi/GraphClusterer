Quantum computing aims to revolutionize data processing by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics. The use of atoms as digital bits marks a significant shift in computer design. The behavior of matter at the atomic scale, governed by quantum mechanics, is distinct from classical physics and presents unique challenges and opportunities. Quantum computers, leveraging superposition and entanglement, have been shown to outperform classical computers in specific tasks, particularly in database searching and certain algorithms. The QBit is a fundamental unit of quantum information, and various quantum computation models, including superconducting, ion trap, and neutral-atom qubits, each have their advantages and limitations. Quantum correlation and discord are measures of quantumness in correlations due to one subsystem. The one-way quantum computation model is used, and simulators like OWQS and EOWQS are utilized for designing and testing quantum algorithms. Ternary quantum circuits have potential advantages over binary circuits, with a focus on subtraction operations using quantum reversible ternary half-subtractor and full-subtractor circuits.
