Recent advancements in quantum computing hardware have brought the field closer to achieving quantum supremacy, with a focus on developing a general-purpose simulator for quantum algorithms. This involves utilizing projected entangled-pair states for strongly interacting 2D systems, where the classical computing complexity is tied to entanglement generation rather than qubit count or gate operations. The study of random quantum circuits helps in understanding memory and time requirements. Superconducting qubits have emerged as a leading contender for large-scale quantum computers, with the demonstration of quantum supremacy using 53 qubits. The challenge lies in performing high-fidelity quantum gates on qubits in the presence of noise, which is where geometric phases and quantum holonomies come into play, offering noise-tolerant and universal quantum computation capabilities. A proposed approach using transitionless driving techniques aims to speed up the implementation of adiabatic holonomic gates, potentially paving the way for practical quantum computers.
