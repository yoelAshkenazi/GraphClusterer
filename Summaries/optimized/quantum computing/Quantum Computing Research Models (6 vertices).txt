Quantum computing research encompasses various aspects, including models, applications, and potential. Different models of quantum computing exist, with a focus on the quantum circuit model, which can be defined concisely, and the concept of universal quantum logic gates. Quantum algorithmic gate design involves simulation methods and the development of a toolkit for quantum algorithm simulation on small quantum computers. A scientometric approach analyzes the evolution of quantum computing research, highlighting a transition from hardware to software-focused research and its impact on various fields. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising strategy for addressing the limitations of current quantum devices, aiming to achieve quantum advantage. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and error mitigation techniques are crucial for utilizing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, which are expected to be the first practical applications of quantum computing.
