Various applications and advancements in drone technology focus on improving efficiency, security, and collaboration in different scenarios. The concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) highlights the challenges of energy efficiency and data sharing in drone swarms, especially in the presence of Byzantine drones that can disrupt consensus, and a blockchain-based solution is proposed to enhance security and improve energy efficiency during multi-drone operations. Drone-assisted radio access networks use drones as relay points between base stations and users to optimize user coverage and connection quality, and a deployment algorithm, DI-PSO, is presented to maximize coverage while maintaining link quality. Data security in drone-IoT applications is addressed through a blockchain-based solution to secure data collection and communication between drones and the control system, ensuring data integrity and resilience. A practical application of drones in cleaning photovoltaic (PV) panels is also demonstrated, showing that drone thrust can effectively remove dust and significantly improve solar panel performance. These advancements collectively showcase the potential of drones in various industries, emphasizing the importance of secure and efficient drone operations through innovative solutions like blockchain technology and optimized deployment algorithms.
