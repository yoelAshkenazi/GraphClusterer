The use and development of open-source technology are discussed in various applications, particularly in unmanned vehicles. Open Source Tools (OST) are popular in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Remote Sensing (RS), with benefits in open-source software (OSS) and hardware (OSH) in UAV technology, including autopilot firmware and data processing suites. An open-source, 3D-printed thruster design addresses the high cost of thrusters for autonomous underwater vehicles, and a portable drone design emphasizes affordability and performance for educational purposes. A formal method for specifying and analyzing Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems (TSDS), such as autonomous drone applications, focuses on time constraints, proposing a Multiset Rewriting language and discussing realizability and survivability. Overall, open-source technology showcases diverse applications and benefits in unmanned vehicles, highlighting accessibility, affordability, and community-driven solutions.
