Open-source technology is being utilized and developed in various unmanned vehicle applications. Open-source software and hardware are used in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), offering benefits and use cases, and specific software and hardware tools are employed in UAV technology. A cost-effective, open-source, 3D-printed thruster design for autonomous underwater vehicles has been created, providing a design approach and performance data for custom thrusters. A portable drone design for educational purposes has been developed, focusing on affordability and component availability, and includes a detailed propeller design analysis for students studying drone principles. Additionally, a formal approach to specifying and analyzing Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems (TSDS) has been introduced, particularly for autonomous drones, using a Multiset Rewriting language with time constraints, and exploring realizability, survivability, and a class of systems called Progressive Timed Systems (PTS) with associated complexity results. Open-source solutions showcase potential in unmanned vehicle technology, providing valuable resources and methodologies for researchers, students, and developers.
