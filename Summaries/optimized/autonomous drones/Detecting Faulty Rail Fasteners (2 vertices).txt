The safety of railway transportation heavily relies on the detection and repair of faulty components, particularly rail fasteners. A novel approach to identifying missing or faulty fasteners uses deep learning techniques and autonomous drone imagery, employing transfer learning models like Vgg16 and ResNet101V2, which demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in detecting these faults. The ResNet101V2 model achieved an impressive 99% accuracy in distinguishing between faultless and missing/faulty fasteners. The Mask R-CNN architecture was utilized to label and segment healthy and missing fasteners in drone-captured images, achieving high precision (98%) and recall (96%) values, further validating the method's effectiveness. This approach highlights the potential of combining deep learning and autonomous data collection for accurate and efficient railway maintenance.
