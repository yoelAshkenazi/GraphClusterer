Various innovative approaches to utilizing drone technology are being explored in different applications, focusing on improving efficiency, security, and performance. The concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) has been introduced, with its potential for collaborative drone operations, highlighting the challenges of energy efficiency and data sharing. A blockchain-based solution has been proposed to enhance security and consensus among drones, crucial for complex tasks in Industry 4.0. A drone-assisted radio access network architecture aims to improve user coverage and data transmission between base stations and users, with the proposed algorithm, DI-PSO, optimizing drone deployment and maximizing coverage while reducing complexity. Data security is addressed through a distributed solution using blockchain technology to protect data integrity and communication between drones and the control system, ensuring data assurance and resilience in critical IoT scenarios. An experimental study has demonstrated the effectiveness of drones in cleaning photovoltaic (PV) panels and improving their energy output by removing dust, showing promising results in enhancing solar panel efficiency through drone-based cleaning methods.
