The growing issue of oil pollution in seas necessitates an efficient monitoring system, and a proposed solution utilizes drones equipped with optical sensors and artificial intelligence to detect and classify oil slicks on the sea surface. This monitoring system is divided into three separate Hard and Soft Frameworks that work together, employing computer vision, laser-induced fluorescence, and autonomous navigation. Successful testing of this system for marine fuel slick pollution detection has been highlighted. Meanwhile, the increasing involvement of AI technologies in crimes such as phishing, drone misuse, and fake information generation raises questions about criminal liability when AI systems act autonomously. A shift in criminal policy towards a new legal paradigm, moving from "law as a text" to "law as a code" implemented through technological platforms, is suggested as a necessary development to address the unique challenges posed by AI-related criminal activities.
