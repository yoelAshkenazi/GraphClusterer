Developing an efficient method for detecting faults in railroad track fasteners is crucial for ensuring safe transportation. A novel approach utilizes deep learning techniques and an autonomous drone to capture railway images, employing transfer learning models like Vgg16 and ResNet101V2 to identify missing or faulty fasteners. The results demonstrate the superiority of the ResNet101V2 model, achieving 99% accuracy in detecting faults related to fasteners. The Mask R-CNN architecture was applied to segment and label healthy and missing fasteners in the drone-captured images, achieving impressive precision (98%) and recall (96%) values, thus confirming the effectiveness of this method in fastener fault detection. This use of deep learning and autonomous data collection showcases a significant advancement in ensuring railway safety through accurate fault detection.
