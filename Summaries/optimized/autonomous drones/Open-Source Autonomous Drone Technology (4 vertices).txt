Open-source technology has various applications in different fields, particularly in unmanned vehicles. Open-Source Software (OSS) offers benefits in building fully autonomous drones with advanced capabilities, utilizing software and tools like ARDUPILOT and Open Drone Map. A low-cost, 3D-printed thruster design for autonomous vehicles has been developed using open-source software tools, aiming to increase accessibility for researchers and students in developing countries. A portable drone design for educational purposes has been created, focusing on affordability and widely available components, featuring a waterproof design and high-thrust capabilities. A theoretical framework for Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems (TSDS) has been proposed, specifying and analyzing autonomous drones operating in changing environments using a Multiset Rewriting language with time constraints, and demonstrating time-bounded verification using the Maude system.
