Cash/valuables routing is vulnerable to attacks and robberies, so it is essential to prioritize transport security. This research employs a surveillance drone approach to enhance the transport security of cash/valuables routing. The drone surveillance is as follows: before GVs leave the customersâ€™ points, drones must surveil the GV through the link ahead and ensure their security. Links are surveilled in specific time windows. In addition, an improved iterated local search (ILS) algorithm is designed in this study to optimize the proposed problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is then evaluated in small and large sizes. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed on some key parameters to assess the proposed model. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented in a real-world case study in Iran, with the results analyzed..
