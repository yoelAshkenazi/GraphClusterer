Oil pollution in specific marine areas is a growing issue, and a solution is presented in the form of a monitoring system for oil slick detection, involving drones equipped with optical sensors and artificial intelligence to address the challenges of current monitoring methods. The system is divided into three Hard and Soft Frameworks that work together for autonomous monitoring, detection, and classification of thin oil slicks, identification of oil products, and autonomous drone navigation, and has been successfully tested for marine fuel slick pollution detection. Crimes involving AI technologies pose legal and criminal policy implications, with various AI-related crimes, such as phishing, drone misuse, and fake information synthesis, raising the challenge of determining criminal liability, a central concern in developing an effective criminal policy. A re-examination of the legal concept of "innocent harm" and a shift in legal norms, moving towards "law as a code" implemented through technological platforms, is proposed as a potential solution to address the unique challenges posed by AI-related criminal activities.
