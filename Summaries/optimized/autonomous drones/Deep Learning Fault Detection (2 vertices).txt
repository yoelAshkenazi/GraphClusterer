Maintaining railway track fasteners is crucial for safe travel, as missing or faulty fasteners pose significant safety risks. A novel approach to fault detection uses deep learning techniques and autonomous drone imagery, employing transfer learning models like Vgg16 and ResNet101V2 to identify faults related to missing fasteners. The ResNet101V2 model achieved 99% accuracy in distinguishing between faultless and faulty/missing fasteners. The Mask R-CNN architecture was used to segment and label healthy and missing fasteners in drone-captured images, resulting in a highly accurate detection method with precision and recall values of 98% and 96%, respectively. This approach showcases the potential of deep learning in automating the inspection and maintenance of railway infrastructure, ultimately enhancing transportation safety.
