Autonomous technology development and applications are explored with a focus on the Internet of Autonomous Things (IoAT) and its various use cases. IoAT has diverse applications across industries such as healthcare, military, transportation, and home robotics, with deep learning and AI enabling these applications. Designing a flexible IoT antenna for drone-based applications involves a specific manufacturing process and materials. Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) and reinforcement learning (RL) are used in developing efficient routing protocols for drone communications, addressing routing challenges in FANETs through a classification system for RL-based routing protocols. Autonomous technologies play a growing role, requiring innovative solutions to address unique challenges, particularly in networking and communication, emphasizing the need for research to overcome these challenges and improve autonomous systems' efficiency and effectiveness.
