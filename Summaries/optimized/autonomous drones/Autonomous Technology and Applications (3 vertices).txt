Autonomous technology and its applications are discussed with a focus on the Internet of Autonomous Things (IoAT) and its potential across different sectors. IoAT, which includes robotics, autonomous vehicles, and drones, is made possible by advancements in deep learning and AI. IoAT application domains include transportation, military, aerospace, healthcare, and home robotics, and there are challenges and issues in this field. The technical development of a printed IoT antenna for drone-based sensors showcases the practical implementation of IoAT in drone technology. Routing protocols for Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs), which are networks of drones, can be created using reinforcement learning to be efficient and self-learning, but routing in FANETs is challenging due to their unique characteristics. A classification of reinforcement learning-based routing protocols is presented. The breadth of IoAT applications and ongoing research efforts to address technical challenges associated with autonomous systems are demonstrated.
