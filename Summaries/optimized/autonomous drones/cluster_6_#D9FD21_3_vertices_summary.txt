The Internet of Autonomous Things (IoAT), also known as Autonomous Things (AuT), is a relatively new concept for technological advancements that enable autonomous devices to connect and share information without human intervention. IoAT includes robotics, autonomous vehicles, drones, and smart home devices. Recent progress in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is the foundation for all IoAT applications. Using the systematic literature review (SLR) method, we examined five application domains for IoAT: healthcare, military and security, transportation, aerospace, and home robotics. Analysis shows that 30% of the IoAT application domains are devoted to transportation applications, 21% to military and security applications, 19% to aerospace applications, 16% to healthcare applications, and 14% to home robotics applications. Finally, we discuss the current issues and potential research challenges in the context of IoAT..
