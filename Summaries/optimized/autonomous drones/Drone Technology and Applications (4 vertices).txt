Drone technology has various applications and challenges in different scenarios. The concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) has potential for collaborative tasks in Industry 4.0, emphasizing energy efficiency, data sharing, and information security. A blockchain-based approach can enhance security and efficiency in multi-drone collaboration, addressing the issue of Byzantine drones that disrupt swarm coordination. Drone-assisted radio access networks can be improved by optimizing drone-cell deployments using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, maximizing user coverage and maintaining link quality. Data security and integrity are crucial in cloud-based IoT applications, where drones collect and transmit data; a blockchain-based solution can secure drone communication and data integrity. Drones can also be used for cleaning photovoltaic (PV) panels, with drone thrust effectively removing dust and improving panel efficiency. These examples highlight the diverse applications of drones, from communication networks to energy efficiency and data security, and emphasize the need for innovative solutions to optimize drone performance in various real-world scenarios.
