There is currently a growing interest in the area of drag reduction of unmanned aerial vehicles. In this paper, the swarming flight of the fixed-wing drones and a load balancing mechanism during the swarm is investigated. As an example, the swarm flight of EBee Sensfly flying wings is analyzed through the proposed methodology. It is shown that drones through the swarming flight can save up to 70% of their energy and consequently improve their performance. As swarming drones have different loads and consume a different level of energy depending on their positions, there is a need to replace them during the flight in order to enhance their efficiency. To this end, regarding the number of drones, a replacement algorithm is defined for them so that they will be able to save more energy during their mission..
