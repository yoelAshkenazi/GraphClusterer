The use of drones has become increasingly prevalent in various industries, including logistics, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. However, several challenges must be addressed to ensure the safe and efficient operation of drones, particularly in autonomous navigation and collision avoidance. The development of autonomous drone systems has utilized artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning and convolutional neural networks, to enable drones to navigate autonomously in complex environments. These algorithms allow drones to find optimal paths, avoid obstacles, and perform tasks without human intervention. The potential of drones in disaster relief, search and rescue operations, and infrastructure inspection is emphasized, highlighting their ability to access hard-to-reach areas and provide valuable data. Drone swarms pose challenges, including the need for robust communication and networking techniques, and the importance of avoiding collisions and maintaining stable formations. Potential field methods and decentralized flocking approaches have been proposed to ensure safe and coordinated movement within a swarm. The development of hybrid power supply systems and energy management strategies aims to extend the endurance and performance of drones, through the integration of solar cells, fuel cells, and supercapacitors to optimize power consumption and enable drones to operate in various environments.
