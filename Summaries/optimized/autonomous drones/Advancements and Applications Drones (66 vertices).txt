The development and application of drones have been rapidly advancing, with a focus on enhancing their capabilities for various tasks, including surveillance, package delivery, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue operations. Technological advancements have led to the creation of autonomous drones, which can navigate and perform tasks without human intervention, but challenges such as collision avoidance, limited battery life, and the need for efficient energy management systems remain. Researchers are exploring solutions, including algorithms for drone swarms to navigate and perform tasks collaboratively, hybrid power supply systems, and improving drone detection and localization technologies to enhance security and privacy. Drones are being used in various fields, including agriculture for crop monitoring and fertilizer application, logistics for package delivery and inventory management, and disaster response for intelligence and access to difficult-to-reach areas. Concerns about potential risks, such as hacking, accidents, and privacy violations, are being addressed through the development of anti-drone systems and regulatory frameworks to ensure safe and responsible use.
