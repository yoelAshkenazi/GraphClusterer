This article presents two approaches based on deep learning for achieving autonomous navigation and subsequently, conducts an in-depth comparative analysis to elaborate their respective performance. Both methods leverage neural networks to facilitate navigation.The first approach employs a deep convolutional neural network to identify suitable areas for forward movement, while the second method utilizes the droneâ€™s front camera to capture images, which are then processed by a generative network to generate corresponding depth images.. This result underscores the effectiveness of the proposed method.In this paper, we propose a drone assisted radio access networks architecture in which drone-cells are leveraged to relay data between base stations and users. Based on the state-of-the-art drone-to-user and drone-to-base station (D2B) channel models, we first analyze the user coverage and the D2B backhaul connection features of drone-cells. We then formulate the 3-D drone-cell deployment problem with the objective of maximizing the user coverage while maintaining D2B link qualities, for a given number of drone cells being deployed. To solve the problem, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is leveraged for its low computational cost and unique features suiting the spatial deployment of drone-cells.
