The paper studies of the cellular detonation wave interaction with supersonic reacting flow in the scramjet combustion chamber. Comparing the flow fields for the details and the reduced chemical kinetics models is allowed verifying the acceptability of the proposed simplified kinetic scheme. The possibility of using pulsating detonation for the ignition intensification in the scramjet combustion chamber is shown. The technique studied in this work has weighty potential for high-speed combustion applications, including cold start/restart of scramjet engines and support of transition regime in dual-mode scramjet and at off-design operation.The results of experimental study of plasma-based mixing, ignition and flameholding in a supersonic model combustor are presented in the paper.The model combustor has a length of 600 mm and cross section of 72 mm width and 60 mm height.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.This launch allowed for the measurement of the fully supersonic combustion mode under actual flight conditions.The primary program objective was the flight-to-ground correlation of measured data with preflight analysis and wind-tunnel tests in Russia and potentially in the United States.This paper describes the development and objectives of the program as well as the technical details of the scramjet and SA5 redesign to achieve the Mach 6.5 aim test condition.An overview of the launch operation is also given.The results of experimental study of plasma-based mixing, ignition and flameholding in a supersonic model combustor are presented in the paper.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices.
