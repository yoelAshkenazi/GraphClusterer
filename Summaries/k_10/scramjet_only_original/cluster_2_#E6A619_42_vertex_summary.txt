Under a contract with NASA, a joint Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM) and NASA team is preparing to conduct the fourth flight test of a dual-mode scramjet aboard the CIAM Hypersonic Flying Laboratory, “Kholod.” Ground-launch, rocket boosted by a modified Russian SA-5 missile, the redesigned scramjet is to be accelerated to a new maximum velocity of Mach 6.5. This should allow for the first-time measurement of the fully supersonic combustion mode..
