In this chapter, the main challenges for the invention of the scramjet engine is fully presented.The non-dimensional parameters are presented and the main advance centers for the development of the scramjet engine are introduced. Besides, the main parts of the scramjet engine is introduced and their roles on the scramjet engine is determined.In addition, required fuel types for different flight ranges are described.Hydrogen fueled scramjet is an interesting choice to be used as engine of aerospace vehicles because of its high specific impulse.The most important challenge in scramjet engine technology is the thermal management of them.Due to high temperature of combustion, a competent cooling system which is able to recover the waste energy is needed.The multi-stage open cooling cycle was proposed as appropriate choice by many recent studies.In the present study, the optimization of a novel multi-stage cooling system for hydrogen fueled scramjets is conducted in which the waste heat of scramjet is recovered to produce power and electricity.The optimization process has been done through a thermodynamic zero dimensional analysis.The present study results declare that the energy and exergy efficiencies of the system is improved by 49.24% and 45.98% by optimizing the M-OCC, respectively.In both performance criterion of the system a huge sensible improvement is observed by accomplished optimization.
