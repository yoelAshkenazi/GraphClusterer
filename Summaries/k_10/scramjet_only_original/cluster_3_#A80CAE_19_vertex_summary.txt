Abstract Scramjet engines are considered a highly promising technology for improving high-speed flight. In this study, we investigate the effects of using multi-extruded nozzles on fuel mixing and distribution inside the combustion chamber at supersonic flow. Additionally, we explore the impact of an inner air jet on fuel mixing in annular nozzles. To model fuel penetration in the combustor, we employ a computational technique.Our findings reveal that the use of an inner air jet increases fuel mixing in the annular jet, while the use of extruded nozzles improves fuel distribution by enhancing the vortices between injectors.These results demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating multi-extruded nozzles and inner air jets in the design of scramjet engines.The new approach is tested using a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor from circular injector into a Mach 2 vitiated airflow for total pressure and temperature of 0.40 MPa and 1695 K, respectively.The selected operating conditions are representative of the LAPCAT-II dual-mode ramjet/scramjet combustion.The results obtained with the present modelling proposal are compared to those issued from numerical simulations performed with the quasi-laminar chemistry or PSR approach.These results do show that, even for a highly resolved computational mesh, the effects of composition fluctuations remain significant, especially in the vicinity of the injection where the SGS fluctuations of the scalar field are non-negligible.In this integral system, the waste heat of scramjet drives the power sub-cycle whilst the PEM electrolyzer input electricity is supplied by a portion of net electricity output of the cycle.It is figured out that the multi-expansion process reveals more advantages in comparison to the single-expansion process in terms of more cooling capacity, electricity and H_2 production.For the fuel mass flow rate of 0.4 kg/s, the cooling capacity of the new proposed cycle is computed 9.16 MW, the net electricity output is calculated about 3.38 MW and the hydrogen production rate is attained 42.16 kg/h.
