Achieving efficient fuel-air mixing is a crucial problem for the design of scramjet engines. Due to the very short residence time of the fuel within the scramjet combustor for typical flight conditions, an efficient injection strategy with high penetration depth and rapid mixing is required. For this reason, many mixing augmentation devices have been proposed and investigated, namely wall injection, struts, ramps, cavities, vortex generators and new configurations developed in China. In this survey, their mixing augmentation mechanisms are analyzed and the numerical and experimental studies are described which have been performed for the assessment of their mixing effectiveness. Some novel insights are provided to further the development of large-scale scramjet engines at increased flight Mach number.The ram-to-scram mode transition mechanism in a strut-based dual-mode scramjet combustor has been evaluated numerically, and the influences of the inlet boundary conditions at the entrance of the isolator, the injection strategy and the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio on the mode transition have been investigated. At the same time, the numerical approach has been validated through a turbulent diffusion combustion problem, as well as the effectiveness of the hydrogen-air chemical reaction mechanism..
