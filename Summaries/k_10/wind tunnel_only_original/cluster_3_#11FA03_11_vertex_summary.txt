Abstract The paper considers the details of design and construction of a small-sized wind tunnel with an open circuit and a closed test section for investigating the blades of horizontal-axis wind turbines.The effect of different types of jet straighteners on the turbulence of the flow in the test section has been studied. Turbulence flow distributions Tu at Reynolds numbers Re from 5·10 3 to 2·10 4 are obtained using Laser Doppler Anemometry methods.The flow visualization of NACA 64-618 airfoil at Re = 5·10 3 is obtained.The influences of wind angles on the behavior of a high-speed train were investigated using a scaled-down wind tunnel model (1:8 scale) at the wind angles of 0°, 5.14°, 10.2°, 15.11°, and 19.8°.Based on the experimental results elicited at different Reynolds numbers (9.44 × 105, 1.26 × 106, 1.57 × 106, and 1.89 × 106, corresponding to the wind speeds of 30 m/s, 40 m/s, 50 m/s, and 60 m/s, respectively), the speed of 60 m/s was determined as optimal for wind tunnel tests.The effects of the incoming flow angles on the pressure distribution of the train's streamlined zone and the aerodynamic forces of the train were analyzed.Results show that the pressure coefficients on the leeward side and the symmetrical plane profile curve of the streamlined zone decreased as the wind angle increased.However, the change in the windward side was opposite to that of the leeward side.The lateral and the absolute value of the lift forces increased rapidly as a function of the wind angle, while the drag force was maximized when the wind angle was 15.11°, followed by subsequent decreases at increasing wind angles.
