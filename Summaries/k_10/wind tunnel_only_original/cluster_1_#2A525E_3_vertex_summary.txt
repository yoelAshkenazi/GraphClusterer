A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation. A sucking fan is placed at the wind tunnel front end to simulate wind in the atmosphere and a wind turbine is placed at the backend of the wind tunnel to generate electricity. The wind turbine uses 48 cm diameter blades made from aluminum. The wind tunnel is made up from galvanized aluminum with square front and back ends with side length of 0.75 m and 0.5 m, respectively. The elevation of the tunnel measured from center to center of the front end and back end is 1.5 m. The used wind turbine in the tunnel has 48 cm diameter blades made up from aluminum..
