A new multipurpose wind tunnel with adjustable test section designed in the science and research branch of Islamic Azad University site could be used either as the environmental, subsonic or climatic wind tunnels. For this purpose, a new design approach was adopted in which through the adjustment of the wind tunnel cycle, i.e. the nozzle of test section,it could be utilized as any of the three wind tunnels.Experimental wind tunnel and smoke visualization testing as well as CFD and analytical modeling were conducted to investigate the performance of a two-sided wind catcher. This type of wind catcher is divided internally into two halves for the purposes of air supply and extract. In this study, the two-sided wind catcher model was constructed of two similar one-sided wind catcher models, which were attached together back to back. These one-sided models are 1:40 scale models of Kharmani's School wind catcher in the city of Yazd.Experimental investigations were carried out using an open-circuit wind tunnel and both the induced volumetric airflow into the building and the pressure coefficients around all surfaces of the wind catcher model were measured at various wind angles..
