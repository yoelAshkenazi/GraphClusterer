Abstract The paper considers the objects of a point structure in the study of wind effects on built construction objects. According to the presented algorithm, an experimental study of the wind effect in a wind tunnel designed in the city of Moscow was performed. The result of the work is a comparative analysis of data on wind exposure.The activities described in the paper are aimed at studying flow characteristics in the T-128 wind tunnel. The goal of this study is to work out recommendations on using new equalizing and protective grids with low drag coefficients in the T-128 wind tunnel and to analyze grid characteristics depending on specific features of their structure and flow parameters at places of grid mounting..
