A new multipurpose wind tunnel with adjustable test section designed in the science and research branch of Islamic Azad University site could be used either as the environmental, subsonic or climatic wind tunnels. For this purpose, a new design approach was adopted in which through the adjustment of the wind tunnel cycle, i.e. the nozzle of test section,it could be utilized as any of the three wind tunnels. A design used for environmental wind tunnels and other contraction which was adjusted by 50 % through changes in the polynomial contraction for other applications.The duct installed in the University of Tehran Aerospace Faculty wind tunnel and flow characterization was performed by using CTA apparatus to measure and evaluate the wind flow turbulency in the throat section of the duct, where the wind turbine was installed..
