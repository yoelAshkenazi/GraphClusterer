Abstract The results are presented for a cycle of experimental investigations of flow field characteristics (static pressure distribution, static pressure fluctuations, upwash, boundary-layer parameters) in the perforated test section of the transonic TsAGI T-128 Wind Tunnel.The investigations concern the effect of nozzle shape, wall open-area ratio, Mach and Reynolds numbers on the above-outlined flow characteristics. During the tests, the main Wind-tunnel drive power is measured. Optimal parameters of the nozzle shape and test section perforation are obtained to minimise acoustic perturbations in the test section and their non-uniformity in frequency, static pressure field non-uniformity, nozzle and test section drag and, accordingly, required main Wind-tunnel drive power..
