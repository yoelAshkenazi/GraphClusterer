Under a contract with NASA, a joint Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM) and NASA team is preparing to conduct the fourth flight test of a dual-mode scramjet aboard the CIAM Hypersonic Flying Laboratory, “Kholod.” Ground-launch, rocket boosted by a modified Russian SA-5 missile, the redesigned scramjet is to be accelerated to a new maximum velocity of Mach 6.5. This should allow for the first-time measurement of the fully supersonic combustion mode. The primary program objective is the flight-to-ground correlation of measured data with preflight analysis and wind-tunnel tests in Russia and potentially in the United States. This paper describes the development and objectives of the program as well as the technical details of the scramjet and SA-5 redesign to achieve the Mach 6.5 aim test condition. The purpose and value of a joint Russian-American program to attain overall hypersonic air-breathing technology objectives are discussed..
