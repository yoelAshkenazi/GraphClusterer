Abstract Scramjet engines are considered a highly promising technology for improving high-speed flight. In this study, we investigate the effects of using multi-extruded nozzles on fuel mixing and distribution inside the combustion chamber at supersonic flow. Additionally, we explore the impact of an inner air jet on fuel mixing in annular nozzles. Our study compares the roles of three different extruded injectors on fuel diffusion and distribution at supersonic cross-flow. Our findings reveal that the use of an inner air jet increases fuel mixing in the annular jet, while the use of extruded nozzles improves fuel distribution by enhancing the vortices between injectors. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating multi-extruded nozzles and inner air jets in the design of scramjet engines.A multi-stage open cooling cycle for co-production of electricity and hydrogen is proposed here in which the fuel of the scramjet is used as coolant of the system.Thermodynamic and exergetic examinations of the advanced system have been conducted to appraise the performance of the cycle, electricity and hydrogen production. In this integral system, the waste heat of scramjet drives the power sub-cycle whilst the PEM electrolyzer input electricity is supplied by a portion of net electricity output of the cycle..
