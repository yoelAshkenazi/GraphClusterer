Experimental investigations of characteristi cs of the flying models (demonstrators) like Hyper-X etc in on-ground test facilities are conducted now in the network of hypersonic technology development. Testing of the scramjet unit on autonomous hypersonic flight lab (HFL) Igla of length Ly~8 m is scheduled in CIAMB together with a number of other research organizations. The program, methods and principles of operation of piston gasdynamic unit (PGU) with multicascade compression (MCC) for complex investigation of characteristics of the HFL and scramjet section under conditions closely approaching to the real flight are described in the paper. The first stage of the Igla HFL pre-model tests in the PGU-7 for Mach numbers ~ 10,13 are also presented in the paper..
