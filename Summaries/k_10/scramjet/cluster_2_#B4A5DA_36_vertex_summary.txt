At present, the critical issue related to design of scramjet engine is to achieve efficient mixing between the air and fuel. Among the several fuel injection strategies, cavity flame holder is identified as a well-organized method for supporting the ignition zone. In this review, some mixing enhancement approaches based on well-known cavity based injection scheme proposed in latest research works, are summarized in detailed. The influence of cavity on the performance of scramjet combustor is recapitulated from three aspects, namely variation of shape/geometry of cavity flame holder; location of fuel/air injection scheme; and recent progresses in dual/double cavity.The scramjet isolator, which is used to prevent the hypersonic inlet from disturbances that arise from the pressure rise in the scramjet combustor due to the intense turbulent combustion, is one of the most critical components in hypersonic airbreathing propulsion systems. Any engineering error that is possible in the design and manufacturing procedure of the experimental model, and the intense heat release in the scramjet combustor, may cause the performance of the isolator to decrease, leading to its lack of capability in supporting the back pressure..
