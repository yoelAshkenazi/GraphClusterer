In this chapter, the main challenges for the invention of the scramjet engine is fully presented.The primary configurations for achieving the recent scramjet engine are also reviewed. The non-dimensional parameters are presented and the main advance centers for the development of the scramjet engine are introduced. Besides, the main significant phenomena occurred inside the scramjet engine are described.The main attention of this work is to investigate the usage of diamond multi extruded injectors on the fuel distribution in combustor of scramjet. This study uses CFD simulations to analyze the effects of upstream shock waves on fuel mixing in the transverse coaxial jet and assess their potential for improving combustion efficiency..
