Donald J. Trump administration have not made final decisions regarding missile defense policy yet. Plans continue to change. The article delivers an analysis of how missile defense budget requests on FY 2020 and FY 2021 correlate with 2019 Missile Defense Review priorities. The first section of the article is about U.S. homeland defense policy.The article is devoted to the development of the US missile defense policy from the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency in 1989 and the subsequent gradual abandonment of the Strategic Defense Initiative program until the adoption of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999.The latter authorized the deployment of a national missile defense system. Analyzing this process, the authors use a comprehensive approach and consider the US missile defense policy not only as a result of changed international security environment, but also in the context of the gradual transformation of the US domestic politics after the end of the Cold War.The authors conclude that by the end of the 1990s, the key prerequisite for the decision to deploy the national missile defense system was not a qualitative deterioration of the international security environment, but rather the internal political victory of the Republicans over the Democrats for the opportunity to form national defense and security agenda.The 1972 ABM Treaty between the USSR and the USA allowed for the deployment of a limited strategic missile defense system, but established a strict ban on the deployment of anti-missile systems outside their national territory..
