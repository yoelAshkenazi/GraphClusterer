Abstract Object 3D printing technology has becoming more and more popular in medicine, we aim to describe the application experiences of 3D printing technology in endoscopic surgery for skull base tumors, with the assessment of 3D-printed models in skull base endoscopic surgery simulation and anatomy learning. We have developed Novel jelly foods that are shaped by 3D printed molds. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer for food manufacturing makes the 3D printed molds. Then, food grade silicone is poured into the cast to make a mold. This type of 3D printed mold can be used widely, such as making sweets, restaurant menus, and care foods by changing the design depending on the use of application. Secondly, we started to develop 3D food printers. This type of challenge to develop future foods by 3D printing technology may have a major impact on the care food because the looks of foods are important and will be improved by 3D printing.Recently, extrusion-based 3D printing has been widely used to manufacture precise and accurate 3D structures with high nanocellulose concentrations due to excellent materials flow control and system stability. With the extrusion-based 3D printing technique, the main challenges for precision and accuracy in high concentration nanocellulose 3D printed structures are proper printing parameters and appropriate adhesion between printed layers. Therefore, this study aims to improve the adhesion between high content nanocellulose printed layers by blending different lignin concentrations and optimizing the twin-screw extruder printing parameters.
