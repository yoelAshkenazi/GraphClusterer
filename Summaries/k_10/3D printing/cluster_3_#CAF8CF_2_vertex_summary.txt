Purpose: Analysis and the review of 3D scanning methods, methods of combining 3D scans and tables available on the market (rotary, tilt and turn) as non-destructive testing systems of polymer materials. As the problem of deformation testing of elements produced by 3D printing is relatively novel, so far a small number of publications on this subject have been observed in terms of current solutions in the area of methodology and devices. Design/methodology/approach: 3D print samples have been prepared using MultiJet Printing (MJP), also called PolyJet Printing. The first sample was left in a UV oven and the second one in a dark cabinet, without access to sunlight (standard conditions 23/50 as described in ISO 554:1976). A comparison of subsequent scans after postcuring with reference scans after printing can indicate dimensional changes. Findings: Universal 3D printing model beneficial in distortion analysis has been proposed..
