Background: 3D printing represents an emerging technology in the field of cardiovascular medicine. 3D printing can help to perform a better analysis of complex anatomies to optimize intervention planning.The major considerations of 3D food printing are printability, applicability, and postprocessing.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate. However, interesting applications concern alternative ingredients such as proteins and fibres isolated from insects, algae, microorganisms, and agri-food residues.Microbiological contamination and migration of toxic substances from printer elements can occur, but effective cleaning protocols and the use of materials authorized to come into contact with foods guarantee the necessary safety standards.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate.The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate..
