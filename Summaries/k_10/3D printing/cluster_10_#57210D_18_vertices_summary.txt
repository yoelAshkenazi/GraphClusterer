3D printing has evolved as a promising production technology that enables products with intricate shapes and geometry. Research in 3D printing has led to technological advances that facilitate the growth of printing technology. However, the production of materials with suitable strength remains a focal point for 3D printing research.Various polymeric materials and composites have been developed using 3D printing technology and examined for their possible applications.In recent years, the utilization of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, particularly a variant using digital light processing (DLP), has gained increasing fascination in the realm of microfluidic research because it has proven advantageous and expedient for constructing microscale 3D structures. The surface wetting characteristics (e.g., contact angle and contact angle hysteresis) of 3D-printed microstructures are crucial factors influencing the operational effectiveness of 3D-printed microfluidic devices. Therefore, this study systematically examines the surface wetting characteristics of DLP-based 3D printing objects, focusing on various printing conditions such as lamination (or layer) thickness and direction. We preferentially examine the impact of lamination thickness on the surface roughness of 3D-printed structures through a quantitative assessment using a confocal laser scanning microscope.In recent years, the interest in 3D printing of medicines has increased due to many advantages of this technology, such as flexibility of the dose and dosage form of the printed product.
