In recent ten years, 3D printing technology has been developed rapidly. As an advanced technology, 3D printing has been used to fabricate complex and high-precision objects in many fields. 3D printing has several technologies. Among these technologies, photo-curing 3D printing was the earliest and most mature technology. In 1988, the first 3D printing machine which was based on photo-curing and called Stereo lithography Appearance (SLA) technology was produced by 3D system Corp. After 30 years of development, many new technologies based on photocuring mechanism emerged. Since the incipiency, significant advancements have been achieved in understanding the process of 3D printing and the relationship of component, structure, property and application of the created objects. Because hydrogels are one of the most feasible classes of ink materials for 3D printing and this field has been rapidly advancing, this Review focuses on hydrogel designs and development of advanced hydrogel-based biomaterial inks and bioinks for 3D printing..
