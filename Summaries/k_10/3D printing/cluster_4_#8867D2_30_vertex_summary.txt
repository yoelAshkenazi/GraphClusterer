Abstract: 3D printing in full three-dimensional printing also known as additive manufacturing is the process of making three-dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process, an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object.3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods. As a result, 3D printing creates less material wastage.Artificial intelligence (AI) and 3D printing will become technologies that profoundly impact humanity.3D printing of patient-specific organ models is expected to replace animal carcasses, providing scenarios that simulate the surgical environment for preoperative training and educating patients to propose effective solutions.Due to the complexity of 3D printing manufacturing, it is still used on a small scale in clinical practice, and there are problems such as the low resolution of obtaining MRI/CT images, long consumption time, and insufficient realism.In addition to providing opportunities to students, faculty, and caregivers in their efforts to integrate 3D printing in special education settings, our investigation also revealed several concerns and challenges.We present our investigation at three diverse sites as a case study of 3D printing in the realm of special education, discuss obstacles to efficient 3D printing in this context, and offer suggestions for designers and technologists.
