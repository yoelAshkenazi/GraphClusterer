This is a review paper on 3D printing and the various materials used in 3D printing and their properties which become a notable topic in technological aspects. First, define what is meant by 3D printing and what is significant of 3D printing.In recent years, the potential applications of three-dimensional (3D) food printing have emphasized this technique's prospects. This chapter details a brief history of 3D printing and a description of 3D printing options for food. It focuses on hydrocolloids in the 3D printing process, with a mention of their use to control the texture of 3D-printed foods.The paper presents the application of 3D printing in the forensic field in order to perform facial reconstruction on a 3D printed replica of the victimï¿½s skull. Firstly, imagine data from a computed tomography of a skull was converted into a 3D model. Then, the 3D skull model was sliced and printed in different positions in order to optimize the 3D printing configuration. Since the quality of the 3D printing process depends on the thermal and rheological properties of the 3D printing filaments, the rheological behavior of the ABS was investigated using melt flow rate and capillary rheometry. Lastly, an accurate skull replica was achieved using the optimal printing parameters.
