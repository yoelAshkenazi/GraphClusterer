In this paper, we propose a back-stepping controller scheme for the altitude subsystem of hypersonic missile of which model is nonlinear, non-minimum phase, uncertain, and highly coupled. In the scheme, the guidance law is selected as a desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method. The back-stepping technique is designed and analyzed for the altitude dynamics of hypersonic missiles for maneuvering targets. Additionally, the algorithm of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used for estimating the uncertainty of model parameters and Lyapunove theorem is used to examine the stability of closed-loop systems. The simulation indicates that the proposed scheme has shown effectiveness of the control strategy, high accuracy, stability of states, and low-amplitude control inputs in the presence of uncertainties with external disturbance..
