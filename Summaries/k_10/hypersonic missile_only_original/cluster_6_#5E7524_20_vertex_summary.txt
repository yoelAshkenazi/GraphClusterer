In this paper, guidance law is selected as desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method.The back-stepping technique is designed and analyzed for the altitude dynamics of hypersonic missile for maneuvering target. Hypersonic missile model is nonlinear, non-minimum phase, uncertain, and highly coupled.In this paper, we propose a back-stepping controller scheme for the altitude subsystem of hypersonic missile of which model is nonlinear, non-minimum phase, uncertain, and highly coupled. In the scheme, the guidance law is selected as a desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method.The simulation indicates that the proposed scheme has shown effectiveness of the control strategy, high accuracy, stability of states, and low-amplitude control inputs in the presence of uncertainties with external disturbance.To determine the nature and extent of Iranian casualties by ballistic missile attacks during the eight years of the Iraq-Iran war.The data collected about Iraqi missile strikes on Iranian cities included the following: date and time, number and type of missiles, cities targeted, and injuries and deaths resulting from impacts of missiles in civilian areas..
