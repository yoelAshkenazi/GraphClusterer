In this paper, we propose a back-stepping controller scheme for the altitude subsystem of hypersonic missile of which model is nonlinear, non-minimum phase, uncertain, and highly coupled. In the scheme, the guidance law is selected as a desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method. The output stabilization results in two-point guidance-law to be actively realized, hence the missile approaches the target until a hit. The guidance strategy is open-loop (it doesn't require active homing), whereas the missile can hit dynamic targets moving uniformly on a linear pathway. Moreover, only the initial triggering of the missile is target-oriented and requires active target data, to be provided by a visual device at the launch stage where the missile is to be directly pointed towards the target before being fired..
