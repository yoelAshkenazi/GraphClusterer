Abstract Additive manufacturing, i.e., 3D printing, is being increasingly utilized to fabricate a variety of complex‐shaped electronics and energy devices (e.g., batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells) due to its excellent process flexibility, good geometry controllability, as well as cost and material waste reduction. In this review, the recent advances in 3D printing of emerging batteries are emphasized and discussed. The recent progress in fabricating 3D‐printed batteries through the major 3D‐printing methods, including lithography‐based 3D printing, template‐assisted electrodeposition‐based 3D printing, inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and aerosol jet printing, are first summarized. Then, the significant achievements made in the development and printing of battery electrodes and electrolytes are highlighted..
