Additive technologies over the past two decades have formed a technological innovation segment of mechanical engineering: world markets for technologies, equipment have been formed, large-scale research and development work is being carried out, standards for product certification are being developed. The article discusses additive technologies and their definition.An object of network nature is investigated, namely: players in the system are located in graph nodes, and the technological structure of their interactions is specified. In this chapter, the basic theoretical and experimental research studies are considered allowing to perform the closed cycle of large-sized complex-profile products manufactured using technology and equipment related to the direct laser deposition process.Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate additive manufacturing (AM) phenomenon extending previous research results by studying in-depth the economic sustainability of AM technology and bringing out the contextual factors that drive its superior performances in comparison with conventional manufacturing, and justify its adoption in rapid prototyping (RP) from an economic point of view..
