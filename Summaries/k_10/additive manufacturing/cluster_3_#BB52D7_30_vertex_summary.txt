Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate additive manufacturing (AM) phenomenon extending previous research results by studying in-depth the economic sustainability of AM technology and bringing out the contextual factors that drive its superior performances in comparison with conventional manufacturing, and justify its adoption in rapid prototyping (RP) from an economic point of view. Design/methodology/approach Data have been collected through a worldwide survey. Findings The results of this research show that although AM-based prototyping leads to significant cost reduction, it is not as good as conventional manufacturing in terms of the profitability of investment. It also demonstrates how cost reduction depends on production volume and scope of AM implementation after controlling for firm size and experience. Research limitations/implications The performance indicator is measured using a Likert scale; however, more reliable conclusion could be made by real amounts.The article analyzes the use of 3D-printing technologies in the construction industry. The main trends in the development of this area related to the development of modern software for 3D printers, printer designs and forming extrusion heads of printers, and also to the development of formulations of building mixes used for 3D printing are noted..
