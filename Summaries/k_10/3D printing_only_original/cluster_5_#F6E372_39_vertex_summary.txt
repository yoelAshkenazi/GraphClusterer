Abstract: 3D printing in full three-dimensional printing also known as additive manufacturing is the process of making three-dimensional solid objects from a digital file.The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process, an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created.3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods. As a result, 3D printing creates less material wastage.Bio printing can be applied to a variety of areas including but not limited to regenerative medicine, drug discovery and development, and 3D cell culture.The major considerations of 3D food printing are printability, applicability, and postprocessing.To bring a clearer understanding of the many design achievements that have occurred in the world of 3D printing, this appendix presents a timeline of design milestones.This should not be regarded as a conclusive list; many more applications for 3D printing are being born daily, and featuring every 3D-printed, first-time accomplishment would be beyond the scope of this book.Rather, the chronology lists objects grown from the 3D printing process for the first time (such as the world’s first 3D-printed shoe or the first 3D-printed guitar, just to name a few examples).For more history on the evolution of the 3D printing process, Joan Horvath’s Mastering 3D Printing is highly recommended.
