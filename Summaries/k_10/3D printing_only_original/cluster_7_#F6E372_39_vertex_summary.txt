3D printing has evolved as a promising production technology that enables products with intricate shapes and geometry. Research in 3D printing has led to technological advances that facilitate the growth of printing technology. However, the production of materials with suitable strength remains a focal point for 3D printing research.Various polymeric materials and composites have been developed using 3D printing technology and examined for their possible applications.Nanocomposites produced using 3D printing technology have potential biomedical, packaging, automotive parts, and electrical applications.This chapter presents an overview of nanocomposites printed using 3D printing technologies and details of the manufacturing challenges.3D printing id the process in which the material get deposited layer by layer to manufacture the product.The principle of FDM is piling up melted printing material (mainly resin material).And crevice of each layer generates layer grooves.The layer grooves make the 3D printed structures mechanical characteristics deteriorate.For example, friction and strength.The 3D printed Structures are difficult to use for mechanical parts.Therefore authors already devised the 3D-CMF (Chemical Melting Finishing).The 3D-CMF is the method that dissolve the convex part of the layer grooves and filled in the concave part of the layer grooves and smoothen the layer grooves.The 3D-CMF changes the surface statement of the 3D printed structures, which is considered to affect the coefficient of friction.In this paper, we investigated the fundamental characteristics of the 3D-CMF and demonstrate of the change of the coefficient of static friction of the 3D printed structures.
