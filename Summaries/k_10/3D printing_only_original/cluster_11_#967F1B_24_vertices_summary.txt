Abstract 3D printing technology is gradually used in the field of stomatology, such as repair, planting, orthodontics and other disciplines. 3D printing process mainly includes four aspects: oral scanning, Digital design, 3D printing materials and 3D printing technology and equipment. The properties of 3D printing materials are the key factors affecting the effect of 3D printing.MethodsA prototype method for MV 3D modelling and printing was developed from computed tomography (CT) scans of a plastinated human heart. Mitral valve models were printed using four 3D printing methods and validated to assess precision. Cardiac CT and 3D echocardiography imaging data of four MV disease patients was used to produce patient-specific 3D printed models, and 40 cardiac health professionals (CHPs) were surveyed on the perceived value and potential uses of 3D models in a clinical setting.ResultsThe prototype method demonstrated submillimetre precision for all four 3D printing methods used, and statistical analysis showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in precision between these methods..
