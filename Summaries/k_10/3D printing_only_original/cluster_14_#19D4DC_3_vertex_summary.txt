Abstract As part of this work, a simulation model was constructed to evaluate the print quality of three-dimensional objects using a 3D printer. A study was conducted using non-contact scanning of a 3D model and varying the parameters affecting print quality, followed by an assessment of the degree to which the printed 3D model corresponded to its standard using software. The result of this study is the obtained values of the optimal printing parameters of the 3D model, which allow to obtain a high estimate of the degree of correspondence of the printed 3D model to its standard, and, consequently, high quality printing on a 3D printer..
