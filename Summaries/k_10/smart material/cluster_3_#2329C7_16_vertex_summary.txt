Digital technologies in experimental and field studies are considered, the interrelation with mathematical modelling is shown, digital technologies in production of materials, products and structures are presented, the brief analysis of development of computer material science is given. BIM and digital technology in the construction economy are under consideration as well. Paper also explains the concept of so-called "smart" home, "smart" district, "smart" city, "smart" region and "smart" country, which are normally used by smart professionals in terms of current realities, long-term and medium-term prospects. The survey results contributed to the implementation of the second stage of the project that was focused on developing three disciplines for the module: “Introduction to smart Materials”, “Research Methods for Smart Materials” as lecture courses and “Practical Course in Smart Materials” as the laboratory practicum. The module is ready for introduction into the education process of a Russian chemical engineering university starting from the 2019–2020 academic year and is selected as the core for a new Master’s degree program “Molecular Materials Engineering”..
