Abstract In this review a strategy for the design of bioinspired, smart, multiscale interfacial (BSMI) materials is presented and put into context with recent progress in the field of BSMI materials spanning natural to artificial to reversibly stimuli‐sensitive interfaces. BSMI materials that respond to single/dual/multiple external stimuli, e.g., light, pH, electrical fields, and so on, can switch reversibly between two entirely opposite properties. This article utilizes hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the design strategy, which may also be extended to other properties, for example, conductor/insulator, p‐type/n‐type semiconductor, or ferromagnetism/anti‐ferromagnetism, for the design of other BSMI materials in the future.Recently, smart interfacial materials that can reversibly transit between the superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity have aroused much attention. However, all present performances happen in air, and to realize such a smart transition in complex environments, such as oil, is still a challenge..
