This paper describes an active vibration isolation platform based on active dampers using the "smart" magnetorheological(MR) elastomers.These composite "smart" materials are a new type of magnetoactive material.The properties of such materials can be quickly and reversibly changed by applying the external magnetic fields.This work focused on the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the active damper based on MR elastomers.Nanoparticles are a universal tool used in broad range of various applications from constructing of smart materials to biomedicine.One of the most challenging fields is development of multifunctional theranostic agents.We developed and analysed the performance of a novel nanoparticle based smart material able to reversibly change its optical properties in response to presence of small molecules in situ.This paper describes development of an interdisciplinary “Smart Materials” module in English for Master’s students in a Russian chemical engineering university.The module is intended for promoting English proficiency of engineering students and internationalizing education by attracting foreign students within the framework of short-term academic exchange.The research stage of project implementation included comparative analysis of international engineering education in Germany and Russia in a form of survey included 30 faculty members and 100 students.The visits to universities in four different regions of Germany allowed for planning the structure of the module and the content of lectures and practicums.The survey results contributed to the implementation of the second stage of the project that was focused on developing three disciplines for the module: “Introduction to smart Materials”, “Research Methods for Smart Materials” as lecture courses and “Practical Course in Smart Materials” as the laboratory practicum.The module is ready for introduction into the education process of a Russian chemical engineering university starting from the 2019–2020 academic year and is selected as the core for a new Master’s degree program “Molecular Materials Engineering”..
