Stimuli-responsive smart materials that can be prepared by various methods have the ability to sense and respond to various kinds of physical and chemical stimuli in their environment. These materials have many potential applications in fibrous materials in the fields of medicine, protection, security communication, and textile electronics. Smart fibrous materials are an interesting class of materials providing various functions in the textiles. The functionality of smart textiles consists of many fields such as informing, protecting, and relaxing the wearer. The objective of this chapter is to present the latest research results together with basic concepts related to the preparation methods, characterizations, and applications of stimuli-sensitive materials in smart fibrous materials and their importance in clothing. Future trends in this area of research are presented and issues regarding technology development and its uptake are highlighted..
