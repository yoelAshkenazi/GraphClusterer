Abstract The paper analyzes a possibility to involve hybrid thermonuclear reactors into the existing nuclear power systems.The possibility is related with production of non-traditional nuclear fuel in thorium blanket of hybrid thermonuclear reactors on D-T plasma. Non-traditional peculiarity of such a fuel consists in significant amounts of some non-traditional isotopes, namely 231 Pa and 232 U, together with traditional uranium isotope 233 U in the fuel.High-energy (14.1 MeV) thermonuclear neutrons can provide accumulation of significant 231 Pa and 232 U quantities through threshold (n,2n) and (n,3n) reactions.The results of hydraulic simulation of the coolant flow for various ways of devices arranging in the irradiation channel of the reactor are given.The analysis of thermohydraulic processes was performed with the help of SolidWorks Flow Simulation software.The report presents a validated strategy of implementation of fast reactors SVBR-100 in nuclear power, which provides putting in operation the reactors using the mastered uranium oxide fuel with postponed reprocessing and changing over to the closed fuel cycle with use of the own spent fuel. By the end of the lifetime, a comparatively high core breeding ratio (~0.84) of reactor SVBR-100 using uranium oxide fuel for operation provides high content of plutonium in the spent nuclear fuel, which could be used in next fuel lifetimes while organizing the closed fuel cycle.That strategy is more economically efficient as the amount of reprocessing in terms of plutonium is approximately 10 times less than the corresponding amount of plutonium extracted from the spent nuclear fuel of thermal reactors.The report also reveals that in the closed nuclear fuel cycle instead of pile (depleted) uranium, the spent fuel of thermal reactors without separating of uranium, plutonium, minor actinides and fission products can be used as makeup fuel similarly to the DUPIC-technology for reactors CANDU.The paper presents the results of a case study on evaluating performance and sustainability metrics for Russian nuclear energy deployment scenarios with thermal and sodium-cooled fast reactors in a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Ten possible scenarios are considered which differ in the shares of thermal and sodium-cooled fast reactors, including options involving the use of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel in thermal reactors.
