Solving the postponed problems of spent nuclear fuel from thermal reactors, that is the main negative component of modern nuclear power in Russia, can be practically put into effect by the closure of the nuclear fuel cycle using fast reactors. Based on the considered nuclear energy systems, taking into account their structural organization and development scenarios, the work presents quantitative estimates and analysis of americium accumulation in the Russian nuclear power industry in the near future and describes the approaches to its utilization..
