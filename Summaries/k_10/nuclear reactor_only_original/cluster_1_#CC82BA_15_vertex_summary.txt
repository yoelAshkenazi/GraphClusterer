In the Middle East region, desalination technology is gaining higher attention as compared to other part of the globe. In this article, we have carried out a study to evaluate the current status of small modular nuclear reactors and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) assisted desalination projects for the Middle East and North Africa region, developing and developed countries of the world. The potential of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for adopting nuclear reactors and coupled nuclear reactor desalination is also discussed.The study of the physics of a nuclear chain reaction as a sequence of fission cycles has established a positive effect of asymptotic limiting of nuclear reactor power after the insertion of positive reactivity and raised the question whether a similar power asymptotic after the insertion of negative reactivity would occur, which could lead to the failure of the emergency protection function of the reactor to establish its subcritical state..
