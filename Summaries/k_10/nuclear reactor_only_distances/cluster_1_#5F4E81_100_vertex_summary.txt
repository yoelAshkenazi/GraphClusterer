Abstract Nowadays, nuclear reactors became extremely fascinating not only for most of the nuclear communities but also for the prominent energy suppliers to fix the global warming effects worldwide. This paper presents a brief review of the capabilities and information on the current status of the CYCLE code.The code allows simulation of key facilities of the external fuel cycle (fuel fabrication and reprocessing facilities, SNF storage, uranium, plutonium, neptunium, americium and curium stores, RW long-term storage sites), nuclear reactors, including RBMK-1000 reactors, existing and advanced VVER reactors (using different fuel types), and fast reactors (both existing and innovative). As an important feature, the CYCLE code allows the evolution of the fuel's nuclide composition both in reactors and at the external fuel cycle phase to be considered in details.Offered as an extra option is the capability to calculate a variety of the nuclear fuel cycle cost parameters for nuclear power plants with thermal and fast reactors.For years, the code has been successfully used as part of INPRO, an international innovative nuclear reactor and fuel cycle project.The results of studies into the Russian NPS evolution scenarios were presented at Global 2011.Some other of the CYCLE-based simulation results were presented at Global 2015..
