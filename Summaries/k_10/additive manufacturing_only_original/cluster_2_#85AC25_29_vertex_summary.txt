Ceramic samples were fabricated from alumina using traditional and additive technologies. Slipcasting technique was used to prepare sample as a traditional way, from pink alumina ceramic slurry with further drying a high temperature treatment of dried preformed ceramics.. It is shown that additive technology due to high accuracy of fabrication is a perspective way of precision fabrication of ceramic parts with high quality.Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing (3DP), and other technology using 3D bioprinting techniques have been used in medical applications for more than 10 years. Currently the primary use of AM in orthopedics is production of implants for total joint arthroplasties. These implants are not individually personalized but use an average bony morphology to develop sizes to fit patients in certain categories. Although the use of AM to produce a personalized arthroplasty implant is somewhat limited by materials and in some cases by a lengthy postprocessing window, the use of AM is estimated to grow at an annual rate of nearly 16% by 2020..
