Abstract Additive manufacturing, i.e., 3D printing, is being increasingly utilized to fabricate a variety of complex‚Äêshaped electronics and energy devices (e.g., batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells) due to its excellent process flexibility, good geometry controllability, as well as cost and material waste reduction. In this review, the recent advances in 3D printing of emerging batteries are emphasized and discussed. The most widely used and most reliable process after the production is heat treatment. In this section, the most commonly used additive manufacturing processes and heat treatments (as a post-process) for metals (titanium, aluminum, steel, etc.) and the effects (microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosive properties, thermal properties) of the heat treatment processes on the material will be discussed..
