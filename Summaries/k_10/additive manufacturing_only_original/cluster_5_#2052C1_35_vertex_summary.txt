One of the most perspective methods of additive manufacturing is selective laser melting. It allows producing the parts directly from 3D-model to 3D-object from metallic powders and alloys. Nowadays the method has very low productivity, which limits its extensive use and possible application to solve a modern design problem by introducing direct and fast metal production.. The analytical data, presented in the article demonstrated the field of process parameters, which can give a possibility to obtain 3D-object with the parameters up to 1 kW for laser source power and up to 0.3 m/s for scanning speed. The analyses of microstructure give a possibility to conclude about no visible difference between the formation of the objects with different laser beam spots. The online video-monitoring shows that with the application of laser beam profiling system the negative effects of the selective laser melting reduces visibly.This study proposes and discusses a methodology for the formation of a list of products for a company or a group of companies recommended to be transferred to additive manufacturing (AM).
