Abstract Additive manufacturing, i.e., 3D printing, is being increasingly utilized to fabricate a variety of complex‚Äêshaped electronics and energy devices (e.g., batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells) due to its excellent process flexibility, good geometry controllability, as well as cost and material waste reduction. In this review, the recent advances in 3D printing of emerging batteries are emphasized and discussed. The unique thermal cycle of metal additive manufacturing is characterized by: (1) rapid heating rate due to high energy intensity with steep temperature gradients; (2) rapid solidification with high cooling rates due to the small volume of melt pool; and (3) melt-back involving simultaneous melting of the top powder layer and re-melting of underlying previously solidified layers..
