Improved solutions for monolithic construction formwork systems are designed to decrease specific weight of formworks, improve the quality of concrete surface and accommodate complex walls. Having analyzed the conventional designs of formwork systems, that consist of prefabricated panels with waterproof plywood bottom attached to metal frame, the authors came to the conclusion that formwork systems need a cardinally new solution in order to achieve the above specifications. A series of experiments were performed on samples of additively manufactured synthetic fiber-reinforced plastic composites..
