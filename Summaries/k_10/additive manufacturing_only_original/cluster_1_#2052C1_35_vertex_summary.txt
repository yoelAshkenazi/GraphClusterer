Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), is a production technique that produces three-dimensional parts. In this process, materials are added gradually, layer by layer to the part. Recently, new materials such as glass, ceramic, and composite materials have been added to this group.Additive manufacturing encompasses a group of 3D printing technologies enabling the generation of complex, biomimetic 3D structures for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.The ability of 3D printing to pattern multiple materials, cell types and biomolecules provides a unique tool to create tissue constructs closely resembling the composition, architecture and function of biological tissues.This review aims to provide an up-to-date report on the development of BG-containing raw biomaterials that are currently being employed for the fabrication of 3D printed scaffolds used in tissue regeneration applications with a focus on their advantages and remaining challenges..
