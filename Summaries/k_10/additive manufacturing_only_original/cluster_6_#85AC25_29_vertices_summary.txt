This paper analyzes the current development of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies exploiting geopolymers (GPs) as promising green and sustainable 3D printable aluminosilicate inorganic materials. Material design and processing strategies to achieve or enhance three-dimensional printability of various geopolymer systems are summarized.The additive design (AD) and additive manufacturing (AM) of jet engine parts will revolutionize the traditional aerospace industry. The main current challenges, perspectives and directions of future work required to improve this technology have been delineated.In recent years, the development of additive technologies has been a priority for industry. The technology makes it possible to realize any design and engineering ideas in high-tech industries, such as shipbuilding, aircraft construction, engine and motor construction, rocket engineering, modern electronic devices, and so on with minimum expenses. However, adaption of additive manufacturing of large-size products is associated with difficulties of transfer of laboratory research results in concrete items for various industries..
