Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing (3DP), and other technology using 3D bioprinting techniques have been used in medical applications for more than 10 years. Currently the primary use of AM in orthopedics is production of implants for total joint arthroplasties. These implants are not individually personalized but use an average bony morphology to develop sizes to fit patients in certain categories.The article describes the approach to the formation of a system of tolerance intervals and the formation of fits for products obtained using additive technologies. The requirements for metrological assurance are justified using the example of the laser melting process in order to improve the quality and further automation..
