Abstract Additive manufacturing, or better known as 3D printing today is one technology that is rapidly growing in several countries. This technology is increasingly having an important role not only in business and everyday products, but in the world of education.In this review the authors provide a comprehensive insight into additive manufacturing process mechanics which explore how thermodynamics give rise to characteristic microstructure and property. Discussion is then given over to how solidification microstructure is modified using processing conditions and utilisation of traditional casting methods which give rise to grain refinement and some cases ‘texture by design’..
