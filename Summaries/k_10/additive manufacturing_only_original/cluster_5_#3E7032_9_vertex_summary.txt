Abstract Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) has been widely used in a variety of industries, including medical implantation. By utilizing digital technology, we are able to create a personalized implant that can represent an anticipated design and surface finish, form, as well as the necessary power it will require. Because research in this field is still in its early stages, fused deposition modeling (FDM) faces several challenges, and there are current limitations in terms of the finish and specifications required for implant manufacturing. A variety of AM methods described in this article are explained here, as are their applications in the field of biomedical implants. In addition to examining recent technologies and future directions for producing more accurate and durable biomedical implants, important new avenues of investigation are opened..
