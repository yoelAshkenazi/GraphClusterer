The rapid development of Space-Air-Ground integrated network, IoT, and swarm-based robotic systems has promoted the transformation of traditional single drone toward drone swarm. Compared to the traditional single drone, drone swarm can collaboratively complete complex tasks with higher efficiency and lower cost, especially in harsh environments. Communication and networking techniques are essential to enabling collaborate information sharing, coordinating multiple drones, and achieving autonomous drone swarm. However, the traditional communication technologies on fixed networks or slowly moving networks cannot address the unique characteristics of drone swarm, such as high dynamic topology, intermittent links and capability constraints..
