Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today. The most important task is today the attempt to create on the basis of system of technical sight completely autonomous system of navigation for motor transport, the marine transport and aircraft.In this paper, we propose a novel concept SwarmGear for autonomous inspection. It leverages a heterogeneous swarm of drones that investigates the environment in a leader-follower formation. The leader drone is able to land on rough terrain and traverse it by four compliant robotic pedipulators, possessing both the functionalities of an aerial and mobile robot. To preserve the formation of the swarm during its motion, virtual impedance links were developed between the leader and the follower drones.The experiments revealed low crosstrack error (mean value is of 2.2 cm and max one is of 5.3 cm with the Type 2 gait) and the ability of the leader drone to move with a 190 mm step length..
