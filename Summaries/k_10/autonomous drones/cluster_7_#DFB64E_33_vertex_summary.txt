Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today. The main tool of the solution of this problem offers use of artificial neural networks of deep training or convolution networks. The quantity of layers and dimensions of local networks at their use is proved in problems of autonomous navigation of drones on the basis of systems of technical sight.In the recent decade, the rapid development of drone technologies has made many spatial problems easier to solve, including the problem of 3D reconstruction of large objects. A review of existing solutions has shown that most of the works lack the autonomy of drones because of nonscalable mapping techniques..
