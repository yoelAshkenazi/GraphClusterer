Advanced technological breakthroughs and exceptional levels of innovation are enhancing the capabilities and potential of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones), and in so doing attracting the interest of a broader swath of logistic companies, online retailers, and governmental agencies. These technology advancements and their impact on regulatory agencies may soon pave the way for the widespread use of drones for delivery and monitoring purposes. Moreover, increasingly urgent environmental factors that include CO2 emissions reductions and other energy-saving approaches are intensifying to need to reduce vehicular usage and congestion, which could further spur their usage. To optimize these systems, drones often employ a hybrid power supply system architecture to boost endurance and performance. Fuel cells, batteries, solar cells, and supercapacitors are examples of power sources that may be combined in a hybrid power architecture. To enable todayâ€™s drones (and those of the future) to work efficiently, the appropriate energy management system must be selected based on optimal and accurate modeling techniques..
