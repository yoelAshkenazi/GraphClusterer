This article deals with the problem of autonomous movement of an unmanned aerial vehicle in space. As a solution to this problem, a mathematical model of the movement of a quadrocopter in space was presented, the technical part was considered.The technical part describes the main components of an unmanned aerial vehicle for the implementation of autonomous flight. As an example of technical implementation, a single-board computer Raspberry Pi 4 and a flight controller based on PX4 were used. As a software part, a special image of the Linux system was used, developed specifically for the implementation of autonomous flights, the main programming language is Python. In the software implementation of the code, an example of an autonomous flight program and the main functions necessary for autonomous control of a quadcopter in the field of Aruco-markers are presented, which allow increasing the accuracy of positioning the drone in a laboratory indoor environment..
