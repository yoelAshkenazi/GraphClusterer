This paper is devoted to solving the problem of research and development of the quantum algorithms operation methods and models of quantum computer. The implemented quantum algorithm allows converting of a classical image into a quantum state, to select boundaries and convert a grayscale image into a binary one. It shows the possibilities of the quantum information theory in interpretation of classical problems.The objective of the work is computer simulation of a quantum algorithm to solve the problem of conversion a classical image using quantum computing and methods, studying existing pattern recognition algorithms and creating an effective recognition model using the features and methods of quantum computing.The relevance of this research lies in the mathematical modeling and software implementation of the quantum algorithm for solving several of classical problems. The scientific novelty of this area is expressed in the constant updating and addition of the field of quantum research in a number of areas, and computer simulation of quantum physical phenomena and features is insufficiently researched in the world..
