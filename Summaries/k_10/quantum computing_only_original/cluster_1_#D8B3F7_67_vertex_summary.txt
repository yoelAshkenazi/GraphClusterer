Originally a part of the study of physics, quantum mechanics is fast becoming an interdisciplinary field. Quantum computing offers the potential to reach the higher levels of accuracy and security associated with a much faster speedup. Seeking the best solution for quantum computers is the mission of both practitioners and researchers.This paper describes the basics of developing quantum algorithms and modeling entangled quantum computations applicable in quantum algorithms. The basic tasks of the simulation proposed in the work are determined within the framework of the algorithm for executing quantum algorithms, taking into account entanglement. A technique has been developed for modeling quantum calculations applicable in the Simon quantum algorithm, which helps to predict the behavior of the quantum algorithm (or any other computing process that proceeds as part of the work of a quantum computer system) with partial entanglement..
