Using, fabricating, and researching in the subject of the smart materials had incredible progress in the last decade. The shape memory epoxy with capability to recover its initial form is one of the smart behaviors in the epoxy composites, which can be used in the electronic devices or wind turbines. The extrinsic or intrinsic self-healing composites are the other smart group of epoxy-based composites, which will be capable to use in the composite structures like aircraft parts.Abstract Until now, enormous smart materials have been engineered with endogenous stimulators such as pH, reactive oxygen species, glutathione, hypoxia and enzyme, or exogenous stimulators such as temperature, light, ultrasound, radiation, and magnetic field in drug delivery. As footstone of stimuli‐responsive nanocarriers, endogenous/exogenous responsive smart materials possess many properties, such as responding ability to specific triggers, controlled drug release, long blood circulation, increased tumor accumulation, “ON‐OFF” switch activities, enhanced diagnostic accuracy, and therapeutic efficacy..
