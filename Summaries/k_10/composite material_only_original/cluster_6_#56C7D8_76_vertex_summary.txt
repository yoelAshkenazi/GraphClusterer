Abstract A mechanism for structuring the dispersion-filled composite materials by the example asphalt concrete is considered in this paper. The effect of an abrupt increase in the strength and water resistance of the material is conditioned the manifestation of intermolecular interaction forces, is shown, which occurs during the formation of binder films between dispersed aggregate particles with a thickness comparable to the radius of action of intermolecular attraction forces.Nowadays waste dumps of phosphogypsum take about 1500 hectares of fertile land and amount to 300 mln tonnes. Existing methods of processing are too labour-and energy-consuming, what didnâ€™t lead to widespread use of phosphogypsum. Phosphogypsum waste continue to be stored in waste dumps, disperse on the wind and create ecological problem in the regions of storage..
