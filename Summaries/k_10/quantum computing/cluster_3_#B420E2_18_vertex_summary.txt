Abstract Intensive research is currently being carried out to develop and create quantum computers and their software.This work is devoted to study of the influence of the environment on the quantum system of qubits. Quantum error correction is a set of methods for protecting quantum information and quantum state from unwanted interactions of the environment (decoherence) and other forms and types of noise. The aim of the work is to study existing methods for correcting various types of quantum errors and to create a 3-qubit corrective code for quantum error correction. The work touches upon the tasks of research and development of the functioning methods of quantum circuits and models of quantum computing devices. The relevance of these studies lies in the mathematical and software modeling and implementation of corrective codes for correcting several types of quantum errors as part of the development and implementation of quantum algorithms for solving classes of classical problems. The scientific novelty of this area is expressed in the exclusion of one of the shortcomings of the quantum computing process.Currently, in many advanced countries of the world, intensive research is being carried out to develop and create quantum computers and their software, and there has been a rapid increase in interest in quantum computers..
