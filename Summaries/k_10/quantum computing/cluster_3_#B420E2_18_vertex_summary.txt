Quantum computing is rapidly shifting from high-tech lab to mainstream commercial use in the next few years, representing the next breakthrough in modern ICT. It is motivated by quantum computer's ability to perform computational tasks with efficiencies that are not possible with classical computers. Although quantum computing has several advantages, it threatens the security of current cryptographic techniques. It is expected that quantum computers will be able to solve the key distribution problem and break every single cryptography and authentication algorithm based on asymmetric cryptography. New emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, 5G, artificial intelligence and robotics all rely on cryptography for their secure operation. Therefore, the realisation of quantum computing will pose significant challenges to the current progress and future development of these technologies..
