The research shows that the real aerial weapon, i.e. hypersonic missile warhead and the target simulator of the MALD type, in bistatic radar result in significantly different topological scattering patterns when taking into account the radiation polarization. Radiation with p -polarization allows for a more expressive topological scattering pattern than in the case of s -polarization, and the Î¸ angle change of the place gives a brighter relief pattern with alternating maxima and deep minima, which leads to an assumption about a high resolving power when identifying the objects by means of the gradient method. A special difference between the two objects, i.e. the target simulator and the missile warhead, can be observed in the case of s -polarization: the patterns differ significantly in topology, the missile maxima regions occupy a larger area, while the minima are much deeper.Studies on missile defense, both in Russia and abroad, have been tradition- ally focused either on capabilities of the US national missile defense system to parry Russian or Chinese strategic nuclear forces, or on regional deter- rence of North Korea and Iran by means of regional missile defense (theater missile defense, TMD). However, the 2019 Missile Defense Review (MDR) emphasized the role of the TMD systems in the regional deterrence of the Russian Federation and China..
