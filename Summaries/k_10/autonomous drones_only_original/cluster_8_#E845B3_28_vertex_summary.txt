To perform complex tasks, drones must have the ability to move autonomously. Ensuring collision avoidance is very important for the safe movement of autonomous drones indoors. However, its use in an autonomous swarm can be problematic. Its complex interconnected structure causes one of the known issues when there are multiple simultaneously active control objectives. They are intra-swarm collision avoidance and reaching the target relative distance (normally referred to as formation control). This paper shows that with collision avoidance active, the standard potential field method will cause a local minima-like effect in an autonomous swarm. To prevent it, this paper proposes a modified curl-free vector field-based algorithm..
