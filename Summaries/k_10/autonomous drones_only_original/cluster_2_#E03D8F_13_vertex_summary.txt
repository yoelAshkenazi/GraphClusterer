In recent years, artificial intelligence has played an increasingly important role in the field of automated control of drones. After AlphaGo used Intensive Learning to defeat the World Go Championship, intensive learning gained widespread attention. However, most of the existing reinforcement learning is applied in games with only two or three moving directions. This paper proves that deep reinforcement learning can be successfully applied to an ancient puzzle game Nokia Snake after further processing.In this article, we propose a complete and robust system for the aggressive flight of autonomous quadrotors. The proposed system is built upon on the classical teach-and-repeat framework, which is widely adopted in infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue..
