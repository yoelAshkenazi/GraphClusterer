The rapid development of Space-Air-Ground integrated network, IoT, and swarm-based robotic systems has promoted the transformation of traditional single drone toward drone swarm. Compared to the traditional single drone, drone swarm can collaboratively complete complex tasks with higher efficiency and lower cost, especially in harsh environments.Considering that drone swarm would usually be deployed in dire circumstances and the network may get frequently partitioned, the robustness of drone swarm becomes crucial.Based on the Molloy-Reed criterion, a swarm intelligent robust solution for drone swarm is proposed by using the consensus method and grey prediction, which has advantages of small overhead and local information exchanging.The simulation results corroborate that the robustness to node failure of drone swarm can be effectively improved by the proposed method.With advances in robotics and digital arts, new ways for artwork execution emerge..
