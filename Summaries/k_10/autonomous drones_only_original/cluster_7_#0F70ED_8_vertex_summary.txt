Potential field approaches have been often used to describe and model interactions within a swarm of robots performing collective motion, also called flocking. Despite the high number of proposed approaches, most have only been tested in simulation and among the minority tested on real robots, even fewer abandoned the laboratory boundaries in favor of real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a decentralized flocking approach that builds over the classical potential field models and that is proved to work well both in simulated and real-world environments..
