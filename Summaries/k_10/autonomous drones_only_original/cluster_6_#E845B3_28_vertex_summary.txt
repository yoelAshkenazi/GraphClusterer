This article presents two approaches based on deep learning for achieving autonomous navigation and subsequently, conducts an in-depth comparative analysis to elaborate their respective performance. The first approach employs a deep convolutional neural network to identify suitable areas for forward movement, while the second method utilizes the droneâ€™s front camera to capture images, which are then processed by a generative network to generate corresponding depth images..
