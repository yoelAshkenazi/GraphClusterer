Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today. The main tool of the solution of this problem offers use of artificial neural networks of deep training or convolution networks. The quantity of layers and dimensions of local networks at their use is proved in problems of autonomous navigation of drones on the basis of systems of technical sight.The use of nano-drones to build a map is an effective method of obtaining a plan of hard-to-reach places. The experimental results revealed a sufficient accuracy in the swarm landing task on a static mobile platform (error of 4.2 cm in homogeneous formation and 1.9 cm in leader-follower formation) and on moving platform (error of 6.9 cm in homogeneous formation and 4.7 cm in leader-follower formation). Moreover, the drones showed a good landing on a platform moving along a complex trajectory (average error of19.4 cm) in leader-follower formation.The proposed SwarmHawk technology can be potentially applied in various swarm scenarios, including complex environment exploration, inspection, and drone delivery.The creation of remotely controlled and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an extremely important direction in the development of small aviation..
