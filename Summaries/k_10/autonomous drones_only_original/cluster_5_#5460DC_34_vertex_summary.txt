Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today. The most important task is today the attempt to create on the basis of system of technical sight completely autonomous system of navigation for motor transport, the marine transport and aircraft. In article the problem of creation of such system for the drone which is carrying out research or rescue operations on the difficult area is considered.The continuous monitoring by drone swarms remains a challenging problem due to the lack of power supply and the inability of drones to land on uneven surfaces.Heterogeneous swarms can support longer inspections, however, their capabilities are limited by the mobility of wheeled and legged robots in a cluttered environment.In this paper, we propose a novel concept SwarmGear for autonomous inspection. It leverages a heterogeneous swarm of drones that investigates the environment in a leader-follower formation..
