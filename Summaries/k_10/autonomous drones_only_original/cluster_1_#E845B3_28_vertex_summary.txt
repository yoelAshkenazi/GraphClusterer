Indoor positioning and navigation inside an area with no GPS-data availability is a challenging problem. There are applications such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, navigation of drones inside tunnels, in which indoor positioning gets crucial. In this paper, a tandem architecture of deep network-based systems, for the first time to our knowledge, is developed to address this problem. This structure is trained on the scene images being obtained through scanning of the desired area segments using photogrammetry. A QCM is chosen for a drone using the shortest path algorithm considering the waiting time at a QCM, charging time, End-to-End (E2E) flight time and other similar time and distance-based criteria for the drone services..
