A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation. A sucking fan is placed at the wind tunnel front end to simulate wind in the atmosphere and a wind turbine is placed at the backend of the wind tunnel to generate electricity. The wind turbine uses 48 cm diameter blades made from aluminum.Experimental wind tunnel and smoke visualization testing was conducted to investigate the performance of a two-sided wind catcher.This type of wind catcher is divided internally into two halves for the purposes of air supply and extract.In this study, the two-sided wind catcher model was constructed of two similar one-sided wind catcher models, which were attached back to back.These one-sided models are 1:40 scale models of Kharmani's School wind catcher in the city of Yazd.The experimental investigations demonstrated the potential of two-sided wind catcher for enhancing the natural ventilation inside buildings.It can be seen that CFD simulation and analytical modeling results have a good agreement with the experimental results.The influences of wind angles on the behavior of a high-speed train were investigated using a scaled-down wind tunnel model (1:8 scale) at the wind angles of 0°, 5.14°, 10.2°, 15.11°, and 19.8°.Based on the experimental results elicited at different Reynolds numbers (9.44 × 105, 1.26 × 106, 1.57 × 106, and 1.89 × 106, corresponding to the wind speeds of 30 m/s, 40 m/s, 50 m/s, and 60 m/s, respectively), the speed of 60 m/s was determined as optimal for wind tunnel tests.The effects of the incoming flow angles on the pressure distribution of the train's streamlined zone and the aerodynamic forces of the train were analyzed.The lateral and the absolute value of the lift forces increased rapidly as a function of the wind angle, while the drag force was maximized when the wind angle was 15.11°, followed by subsequent decreases at increasing wind angles.The efficiency of new optimized wind tunnel diffuser increased by 83 percent in comparison to the sample of supersonic wind tunnel.
