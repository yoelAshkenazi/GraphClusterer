Traditionally, wind tunnel models are made of metal and the processes are very expensive. Since then, many researchers have been looking for new alternatives, hence 3D printing technology is the solution.Under right test conditions, 3D printed parts could be tested in a wind tunnel to get the aerodynamic performances. By using 3D printing technology, the cost and time can be significantly reduced to produce the wind tunnel models.Abstract The paper considers the details of design and construction of a small-sized wind tunnel with an open circuit and a closed test section for investigating the drag of horizontal-axis wind turbines.The effect of different types of jet straighteners on the turbulence of the flow in the test section has been studied..
