A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation. The duct installed in the University of Tehran Aerospace Faculty wind tunnel and flow characterization was performed by using CTA apparatus to measure and evaluate the wind flow turbulency in the throat section of the duct, where the wind turbine was installed. The wind tunnel is made up from galvanized aluminum with square front and back ends with side length of 0.75 m and 0.5 m, respectively..
