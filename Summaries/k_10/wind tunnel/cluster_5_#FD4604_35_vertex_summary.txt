At present experimental gas-dynamic studies of supersonic flows mainly use complex experimental facilities, such as aerodynamic wind tunnels and shock tubes. However, in order to study supersonic flows with Mach numbers M < 4, a vacuum wind tunnel (which is much simpler) can also be used. This paper is concerned with starting processes occurring in a vacuum wind tunnel.A review of foreign and Russian sources is given mentioning the pioneering wind tunnels built in Russia at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries. The first wind tunnel in Russia was constructed by V.A. Pashkevich at the Mikhailovsky Artillery Academy in St. Petersburg in 1871. In total from 1871 through 1915, 18 wind tunnels were constructed in Russia: 11 in Moscow, 5 in St. Petersburg and 2 in Kaluga..
