A new multipurpose wind tunnel with adjustable test section designed in the science and research branch of Islamic Azad University site could be used either as the environmental, subsonic or climatic wind tunnels.. For this purpose, a new design approach was adopted in which through the adjustment of the wind tunnel cycle, i.e. the nozzle of test section,it could be utilized as any of the three wind tunnels. A design used for environmental wind tunnels and other contraction which was adjusted by 50 % through changes in the polynomial contraction for other applications.. This model is useful for predicting flow behavior in the experimental wind tunnel.The main geometric features of wind tunnel models and their units, such as the accuracy of the model's location in the wind tunnel's test section, accuracy of the model's assembly, deviations from specified aerodynamic twists and V-shaped wings, reproduction of the outlines of the main surface profiles, etc., are evaluated by the model's surface points by measuring the data using a coordinatemeasuring machine (CMM).
