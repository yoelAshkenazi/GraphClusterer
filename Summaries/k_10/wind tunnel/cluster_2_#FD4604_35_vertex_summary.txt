At present experimental gas-dynamic studies of supersonic flows mainly use complex experimental facilities, such as aerodynamic wind tunnels and shock tubes. However, in order to study supersonic flows with Mach numbers M < 4, a vacuum wind tunnel (which is much simpler) can also be used. This paper is concerned with starting processes occurring in a vacuum wind tunnel.Abstract The relationship of the pulsations of flow in the settling chamber with the pulsations of supersonic flow in the test section of the T-325 wind tunnel of ITAM RAS was investigated..
