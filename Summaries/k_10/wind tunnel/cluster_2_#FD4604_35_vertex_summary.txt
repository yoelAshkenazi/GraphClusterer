At present experimental gas-dynamic studies of supersonic flows mainly use complex experimental facilities, such as aerodynamic wind tunnels and shock tubes. However, in order to study supersonic flows with Mach numbers M < 4, a vacuum wind tunnel (which is much simpler) can also be used.This paper is concerned with starting processes occurring in a vacuum wind tunnel.In order to predict the laminar/turbulent transition on a hypersonic vehicle forebody at Mach numbers 4 and 6, the three-dimensional (3D) modal linear stability analysis is applied, coupled with the eN method. Nevertheless, N factors are unknown for wind tunnel conditions.Experiments for the forebody are currently in progress and will allow checking the predicted transition location.This paper presents the results of a numerical investigation of the wind tunnel model relative size effect on experimentally obtained aerodynamic characteristics.In the framework of TsAGIâ€™s supersonic wind tunnel modernization program aimed at improving flow quality and extending the range of test regimes it was required to design and numerically validate a new test section and a set of shaped nozzles: two flat nozzles with Mach number at nozzle exit M=4 and M=5 and two axisymmetric nozzles with M=5 and M=6.
