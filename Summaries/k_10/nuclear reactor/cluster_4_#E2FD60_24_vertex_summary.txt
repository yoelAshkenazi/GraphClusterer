Abstract Nuclear reactor core design is one of the most complex issues that nuclear engineers deal with. The number and complexity of effective parameters and their impact on reactor design, which makes the problem difficult to solve. Numerous factors in a nuclear reactor core design depend on the Fuel-to-Moderator volume ratio, V F / V M, in a fuel cell. This ratio can be modified by changing the lattice pitch which is the thickness of water channels between fuels plates while keeping fuel slab dimensions fixed.The efficiency of the calculation method makes it useful for small size nuclear reactors such as the ones used in space missions.The necessity of coolant flow consumption measurement accuracy increase in the nuclear reactor primary circuit has been substantiated.Moreover, the need to control the coolant condition in the current flow inside the pipeline is shown.Nowadays, the real-time coolantâ€™s condition control function is not implemented at stationary nuclear power plants or mobile nuclear power plants used in moving objects.It is shown that a coolant consumption measurement error decreases and its condition data availability increases the heat transfer efficiency and the electrical energy generation (without the nuclear reactor and steam generator design change).The nuclear reactor analysis code, MTR-PC package is employed to carry out the considered calculation.Finally, the results are presented in some tables and graphs that provide useful information for nuclear engineers in the nuclear reactor core design..
