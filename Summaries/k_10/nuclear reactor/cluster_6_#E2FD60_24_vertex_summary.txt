Abstract Spent Nuclear Fuels Storage (SNFS) is an essential auxiliary facility in nuclear reactors.To be stored in water pool of SNFS at the reactor or away from reactor to allow for radioactive decay. The storage pool is filled with demineralized water which serves as moderator, coolant and shielding. To prevent corrosion damage of fuels and other equipment a purification system controls the water quality. In this paper, design of a water purification system for optimal water supply and its chemical parameters in the spent fuels storage pool is presented.The reactor core is simulated based on the multi-point nuclear reactor model (neutronic and thermal-hydraulic).In this model, the reactor core is divided into four nodes along the reactor axis.Simulation results show that this method improves the reactor load-following capability in the presence of parameter uncertainty and disturbances.The reactor core is simulated based on the multi-point nuclear reactor model (neutronic and thermal-hydraulic).Simulation results show that this method improves the reactor load-following capability in the presence of parameter uncertainty and disturbances.The reactor core is simulated based on the multi-point nuclear reactor model (neutronic and thermal-hydraulic).Simulation results show that this method improves the reactor load-following capability in the presence of parameter uncertainty and disturbances.The reactor core is simulated based on the multi-point nuclear reactor model (neutronic and thermal-hydraulic).Simulation results show that this method improves the reactor load-following capability in the presence of parameter uncertainty and disturbances.The reactor core is simulated based on the multi-point nuclear reactor model (neutronic and thermal-hydraulic).Simulation results show that this method improves the reactor load-following capability in the presence of parameter uncertainty and disturbances.The reactor core is simulated based on the multi-point nuclear reactor model (neutronic and thermal-hydraulic).Simulation results show that this method improves the reactor load-following capability in the presence of parameter uncertainty and disturbances.The reactor core is simulated based on the multi-point nuclear reactor model (neutronic and thermal-hydraulic).
