Abstract Nuclear reactor core design is one of the most complex issues that nuclear engineers deal with. The number and complexity of effective parameters and their impact on reactor design, which makes the problem difficult to solve, require precise knowledge of these parameters and their influence on the reactor operation. Numerous factors in a nuclear reactor core design depend on the Fuel-to-Moderator volume ratio, V F / V M, in a fuel cell.In nuclear reactor, spatial oscillations in neutron flux distribution resulting from xenon reactivity feedback are a matter of concern. If the oscillations in power distribution are not controlled, power density and rate of change of power at some locations in the reactor core may exceed their respective limits causing the nuclear power plant instability. Therefore, during the design stages of any Pressurized Water Nuclear Reactor (P.W.R), it is necessary to identify the existence of xenon oscillation and to design suitable control strategy for regulating the spatial power distribution..
