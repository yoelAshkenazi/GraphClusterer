A brief exposition of the principles of the use of nuclear reactions for energy generation is given.Current ways of utilising nuclear energy are described starting with main sources of utilising nuclear energy.The nuclear fuel cycle is introduced followed by brief characterisation of most used power reactors such as boiling water reactor, pressurised water reactor and water-water energetic reactor.This article presents an innovative nuclear power technology, based on the use of modular type fast-neutron reactors SVBR-75/100 having heavy liquid-metal coolant, i.e. eutectic lead–bismuth alloy, which was mastered in Russia for the nuclear submarines’ reactors.The main goal of the work is to identify the advantages of fast reactors when using nanotechnology in the manufacture of core materials The research methods are based on the adaptation of known technologies (including powder metallurgy) to the design of small power fast reactors and on the numerical simulation of physical processes carried out using computer programs for analysis of emergency conditions of fast reactors (including anticipated transient without scram - ATWS)..
