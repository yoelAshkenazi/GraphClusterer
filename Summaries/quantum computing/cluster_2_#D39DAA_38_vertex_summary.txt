Using atoms as digital bits will start a completely new era in computer design. The author describes how such a quantum computer-a computer based on the rules of quantum mechanics-may work, and how it is going to give incredible speed and problem-solving power.We construct explicit DAQC protocols for efficient simulations of arbitrary inhomogeneous Ising, two-body, and $M$-body spin Hamiltonian dynamics by means of single-qubit gates and a fixed homogeneous Ising Hamiltonian. Additionally, we compare a sequential approach where the interactions are switched on and off (stepwise DAQC) with an always-on multiqubit interaction interspersed by fast single-qubit pulses (banged DAQC)..
