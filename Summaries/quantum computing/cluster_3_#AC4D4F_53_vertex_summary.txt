Abstract The article presents a historical overview of the mathematical idea of a quantum computing model - a new computational strategy based on the postulates of quantum mechanics and having advantages over the traditional computational model based on the Turing machine; clarified the features of the operation of multi-qubit quantum systems, which ensure the creation of efficient algorithms; the principles of quantum computing are outlined and a number of efficient quantum algorithms are described that allow solving the problem of exponential growth of the complexity of certain problems..
