The dual-mode scramjet combustor is a promising candidate for the combined cycle engine of the hypersonic airplane, and the flame propagation and stabilization process in the dual-mode scramjet combustor has a great impact on its performance improvement. In this review, the recent research progress on the transverse injection technique for scramjet applications is covered from three perspectives, namely multi-porthole injection strategy, parametric sensitivity to the jet properties, and finally the geometric features of the wall surface. This review reveals that the multi-porthole injection strategy is favourable in accelerating the wall cooling and near-field mixing along with reducing the loss of total pressure whereas a parametric investigation has a promising effect on jet penetration as well as mixing improvement in supersonic cross-flow. Additionally, the formation of the shock upstream of the fuel jet is greatly helpful in the mixing process in the scramjet engines, hence sinusoidal as well as a wavy wall are used in transverse injection flow-field. Finally, a brief discussion regarding the future study on the transverse injection technique is also provided..
