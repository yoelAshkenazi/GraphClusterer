The method takes into account the dynamic target scattering crossover. The efficiency is evaluated by conducting statistical tests on a simulation model and constructing a vertical section of the detection zone. In this case, the effective target scattering crossover of a hypersonic cruise missile is calculated depending on the parameters of its movement around the center of mass relative to the ground - based detection radar and its line of sight.This paper examines the impact of hypersonic threat on the evolution of the U.S. missile defense. The article analyzes the specifics of this threat, examines related doctrinal and practical changes, describes and characterizes planned defense architecture, forecasts the prospects for its implementation and impact on the strategic situation..
