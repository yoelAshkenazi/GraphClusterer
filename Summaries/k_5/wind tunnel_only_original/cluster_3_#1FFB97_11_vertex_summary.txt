Traditionally, wind tunnel models are made of metal and the processes are very expensive. Since then, many researchers have been looking for new alternatives, hence 3D printing technology is the solution. Under right test conditions, 3D printed parts could be tested in a wind tunnel to get the aerodynamic performances. By using 3D printing technology, the cost and time can be significantly reduced to produce the wind tunnel models.Abstract The results are presented for a cycle of experimental investigations of flow field characteristics (static pressure distribution, static pressure fluctuations, upwash, boundary-layer parameters) in the perforated test section of the transonic TsAGI T-128 Wind Tunnel..
