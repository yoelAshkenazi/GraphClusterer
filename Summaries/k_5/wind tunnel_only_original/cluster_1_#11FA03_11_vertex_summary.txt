Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to find the optimum design of diffuser of supersonic wind tunnel in order to access the minimum overall pressure drop in wind tunnel, using evolutionary algorithm. Design/methodology/approach – The authors developed a genetic algorithm (GA) code to calculate the shape of a diffuser with flexible walls in order to have the maximum pressure recovery. The two-dimensional turbulent and compressible flow was analyzed numerically using shear-stress transport and Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSM)+ turbulence models and its optimization with GA. Findings – The results of this study indicate that elitist GA promises a powerful method for optimization of the wind tunnel diffuser.An automatically controlled variable converging-diverging supersonic nozzle with high dependability is required for wide range of Mach numbers in a supersonic wind tunnel..
