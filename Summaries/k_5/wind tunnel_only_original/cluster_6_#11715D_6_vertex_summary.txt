A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation. A sucking fan is placed at the wind tunnel front end to simulate wind in the atmosphere and a wind turbine is placed at the backend of the wind tunnel to generate electricity. The wind turbine uses 48 cm diameter blades made from aluminum. The wind tunnel is made up from galvanized aluminum with square front and back ends with side length of 0.75 m and 0.5 m, respectively. The tunnel structure is made up from galvanized aluminum with square front and back ends with side length of 0.75 m and 0.5 m, respectively.In accordance with the unsteady-state finite-difference computer model was developed to study the heat convection between the air and the tunnel wall as well as the heat transfer in the surrounding rock and at interfaces between different materials in the structure of the tunnel..
