A natural barrier, such as a hill or a small mountain, might be the location of a great potential for wind energy production. The expression ‘wind dam’ refers to a newly proposed concept which aims to take advantage from the existing geographical natural barriers, in order to generate a high speed wind zone for installation of wind turbines. Previous studies have claimed that excavating a tunnel in a hill, connecting its high pressure zone to the low pressure zone, provides not only a suitable location for wind turbines, but also minimizes the negative environmental and visual impacts of the installed wind turbines..
