A review of foreign and Russian sources is given mentioning the pioneering wind tunnels built in Russia at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries. The Russian scientists and researchers' contribution to the development of techniques and methods of aerodynamic experiment is shown, including one of the most important aspects - the wall interference problem.This paper presents the results of a numerical investigation of the wind tunnel model relative size effect on experimentally obtained aerodynamic characteristics. The investigations were performed on computer-aided design geometry modeling the test section, plenum chamber, diffuser, supporting devices, and test object for the T-106 TsAGI transonic wind tunnel equipped with a closed-jet circular test section with perforated walls..
