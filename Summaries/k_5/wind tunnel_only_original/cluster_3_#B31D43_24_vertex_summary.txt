Abstract Determination of the high potential of dust emission is a requisite affair in the management of dusts emission and as well as avoiding its risks. Wind tunnel is among the most important approaches in the study of areas having high potential in emitting dusts. Extensive dried playas and desert areas require the making of low-cost, simple, and car-portable tunnels capable of presenting comparable data of various areas even supposing not having enough precision in the model of real wind motion. In this study, we first engaged in making a car-portable tunnel with a primarily semicircle section of 38 cm height, 50 cm diameter, and 110 cm length. The duct installed in the University of Tehran Aerospace Faculty wind tunnel and flow characterization was performed by using CTA apparatus to measure and evaluate the wind flow turbulency in the throat section of the duct, where the wind turbine was installed. Wind speed analysis was done at different speed of the wind tunnel test section and shown that in the throat section of the duct the wind speed increased with a constant slope and in more analysis, it was found the wind speed in the duct throat can be increased to 2.5 up to 3 times of free stream flow speed at a different wind speed of wind tunnel test section..
