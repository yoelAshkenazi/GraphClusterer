Due to the increased rate of drone usage in various commercial and industrial fields, the need for their autonomous operation is rapidly increasing. The majority of current works are persistently using a global positioning system (GPS) to directly find the absolute position of the drone. However, GPS accuracy might be not suitable in some applications and this solution is not applicable to all situations. In this paper, a positioning system based on monocular SLAM and inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented. The position is calculated through the semi-direct visual odometry (SVO) method alongside IMU data, and is integrated with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to enhance the efficiency of the algorithm. The data is then employed to control the drone without any requirement to any source of external input. The experiment results for long-distance flying paths is very promising.
