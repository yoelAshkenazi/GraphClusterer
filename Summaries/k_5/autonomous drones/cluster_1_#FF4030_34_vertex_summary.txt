The use of nano-drones to build a map is an effective method of obtaining a plan of hard-to-reach places. The paper presents algorithms for constructing a map using a graph of factors and correcting errors by recognizing a place using a Siamese convolutional neural network.The experimental results obtained with the use of a nano-drone in the autonomous flight mode are presented. The constructed map of the area was evaluated for consistency by a numerical method.Indonesian agricultural products are one of the highest-yielding agricultural commodities on the Asian continent. As a result, with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or a robot flying drone, a system or fertilizer sowing equipment is utilized on plants.The results of this study led to the creation of a hexacopter drone equipped with fertilizer-based sensors and GPS..
