With advances in robotics and digital arts, new ways for artwork execution emerge. One such way is mural or graffiti drawing by flying robots [Katsu 2018; TsuruRobotics 2018]. This is itself a novel approach, which only recently gained traction and moved to full or partial autonomous operations. Key hurdles of drone graffiti are complicated system setup and a long painting process, associated with that only one drone is available at a time. Here we present a multi-drone graffiti dispatch system tested on up to three actual aerial robots operating simultaneously in real-time.. We propose a novel routing and scheduling algorithm, referred to as hybrid truck-drone delivery (HTDD) algorithm, to solve the hybrid parcel delivery problem, wherein M drones carried by M trucks, together with N independent drones, cooperate to deliver parcels to customers distributed in a wide region..
