Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today. The most important task is today the attempt to create on the basis of system of technical sight completely autonomous system of navigation for motor transport, the marine transport and aircraft. In article the problem of creation of such system for the drone which is carrying out research or rescue operations on the difficult area is considered.The paper focuses on a heterogeneous swarm of drones to achieve a dynamic landing of formation on a moving robot.To perform complex tasks, drones must have the ability to move autonomously.The key technology is that instead of facilitating each agent of the swarm of drones with computer vision that considerably increases the payload and shortens the flight time, we propose to install only one camera on the leader drone.The follower drones receive the commands from the leader UAV and maintain a collision-free trajectory with the artificial potential field.The experimental results revealed a high accuracy of the swarm landing on a static mobile platform (RMSE of 4.48 cm)..
