In recent years, artificial intelligence has played an increasingly important role in the field of automated control of drones. After AlphaGo used Intensive Learning to defeat the World Go Championship, intensive learning gained widespread attention. However, most of the existing reinforcement learning is applied in games with only two or three moving directions.This paper proves that deep reinforcement learning can be successfully applied to an ancient puzzle game Nokia Snake after further processing.In this article, instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically equivalent one.The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness.Also, to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles during flights, a fast local perception method and a sliding-windowed replanning method are integrated into our system, to generate safe and dynamically feasible local trajectories onboard.Performance results demonstrate that AutoRelay outperforms existing methods in achieving an accurate and efficient relay strategy.Due to cost reduction and device miniaturization, amateur drones are now widely used in numerous civilian and commercial applications.However, the abuse of amateur drones has resulted in emerging threats to personal privacy and public security.To alleviate these threats, we design an acoustic-based surveillance system, which can achieve the capacity of amateur drones detection and localization with 24/7 (24 hours per day and 7 days per week under normal circumstances) availability.In the designed system, a detection fusion algorithm and a TDOA estimation algorithm based on the Bayesian filter are applied to improve the performance of drone detection and localization.
