At present, the critical issue related to design of scramjet engine is to achieve efficient mixing between the air and fuel. Among the several fuel injection strategies, cavity flame holder is identified as a well-organized method for supporting the ignition zone.The flame stabilization process in the dual-mode scramjet combustor is summarized from three aspects, namely the combustion mode classification, the mode transition and the vitiation effect.The obtained results show that the operational conditions and the geometric parameters both have a great impact on the flame propagation and stabilization process in the dual-mode scramjet combustor, and there exist strong interactions between the geometric parameters, as well as the operational conditions.This is a multiobjective design optimization problem, and the optimal operational conditions, as well as the optimal geometric parameters, should be obtained by the optimization algorithm based on the surrogate model with high fidelity.Achieving efficient fuel-air mixing is a crucial problem for the design of scramjet engines.For this reason, many mixing augmentation devices have been proposed and investigated, namely wall injection, struts, ramps, cavities, vortex generators and new configurations developed in China.In this survey, their mixing augmentation mechanisms are analyzed and the numerical and experimental studies are described which have been performed for the assessment of their mixing effectiveness.Some novel insights are provided to further the development of large-scale scramjet engines at increased flight Mach number.The need for additional research based on improved numerical approaches and experimental facilities is stressed.Experimental investigations of characteristi cs of the flying models (demonstrators) like Hyper-X etc in on-ground test facilities are conducted now in the network of hypersonic technology development..
