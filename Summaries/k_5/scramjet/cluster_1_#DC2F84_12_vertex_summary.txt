In this chapter, the main challenges for the invention of the scramjet engine is fully presented.The non-dimensional parameters are presented and the main advance centers for the development of the scramjet engine are introduced. Besides, the main parts of the scramjet engine is introduced and their roles on the scramjet engine is determined. In addition, required fuel types for different flight ranges are described.A multi-stage open cooling cycle of scramjet for electricity and hydrogen co-production is proposed in which the fuel of scramjet is used as coolant of cooling cycle.Thermodynamic and exergetic examinations of the advanced system have been conducted to appraise the performance of the cycle, electricity and hydrogen production. In this integral system, the waste heat of scramjet drives the power sub-cycle whilst the PEM electrolyzer input electricity is supplied by a portion of net electricity output of the cycle..
