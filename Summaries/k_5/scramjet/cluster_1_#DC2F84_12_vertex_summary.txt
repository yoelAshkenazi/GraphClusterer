Abstract Scramjet engines are considered a highly promising technology for improving high-speed flight.The most important challenge in scramjet engine technology is the thermal management of them.Due to high temperature of combustion, a competent cooling system which is able to recover the waste energy is needed.The multi-stage open cooling cycle was proposed as appropriate choice by many recent studies.In this study, the optimization of a novel multi-stage cooling system for hydrogen fueled scramjets is conducted in which the waste heat of scramjet is recovered to produce power and electricity.The optimization process has been done through a thermodynamic zero dimensional analysis.The results reveal that the use of an inner air jet increases fuel mixing in the annular jet, while the use of extruded nozzles improves fuel distribution by enhancing the vortices between injectors.These results demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating multi-extruded nozzles and inner air jets in the design of scramjet engines..
