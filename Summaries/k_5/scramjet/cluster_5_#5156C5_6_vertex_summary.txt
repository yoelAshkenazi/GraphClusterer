The accurate parameter prediction of a flow field is of practical significance to promote the development of hypersonic flight. Velocity field prediction using deep learning is a promising method to provide an accurate velocity field in a scramjet isolator. A new approach for the velocity field prediction in a scramjet isolator is developed in this study. A data-driven model is proposed for the prediction of the velocity field in a scramjet isolator by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using measurements of the pressure on the isolator. Numerical simulations of flow in a three-dimensional scramjet isolator at various Mach numbers and backpressures are carried out to establish the dataset capturing the flow mechanism over various operating conditions..
