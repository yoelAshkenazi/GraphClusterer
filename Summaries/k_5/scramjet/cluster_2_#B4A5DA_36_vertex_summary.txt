At present, the critical issue related to design of scramjet engine is to achieve efficient mixing between the air and fuel. Among the several fuel injection strategies, cavity flame holder is identified as a well-organized method for supporting the ignition zone. In this review, some mixing enhancement approaches based on well-known cavity based injection scheme proposed in latest research works, are summarized in detailed.The three-dimensional Reynolds-average Navier–Stokes equations coupled with the SST k–ω turbulence model have been employed to investigate the interaction of the oblique shock wave and the hydrogen jet, and the influence of the wedge angle has been taken into consideration, namely the intensity of the produced oblique shock wave, and there exists a critical value of the wedge angle for the scramjet engine with a certain boundary condition.This value is 20° in the range considered in the current study, and the hydrogen is brought into the separation zone upstream of the jet orifice when the wedge angle is 20°.At the same time, the produced oblique shock wave nearly collides with the Mach disk produced by the hydrogen jet.The flow structures of all cases have been discussed and compared.The quantitative evaluation results of three optimization cases show that the extreme difference analysis approach is an efficient parametric analysis method, and it can obtain the optimal strategy for the micro-ramp within scramjet combustors with the transverse hydrogen jet..
