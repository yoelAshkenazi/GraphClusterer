Hydrogen fueled scramjet is an interesting choice to be used as engine of aerospace vehicles because of its high specific impulse. The most important challenge in scramjet engine technology is the thermal management of them. Due to high temperature of combustion, a competent cooling system which is able to recover the waste energy is needed. The multi-stage open cooling cycle was proposed as appropriate choice by many recent studies. In the present study, the optimization of a novel multi-stage cooling system for hydrogen fueled scramjets is conducted in which the waste heat of scramjet is recovered to produce power and electricity. The optimization process has been done through a thermodynamic zero dimensional analysis..
