Flow and combustion of a hydrocarbon-air mixture in a channel modeling a section of a supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) are considered. Several fuels and corresponding chemical kinetics models are considered.. It has been shown that some regimes of burning are non-stationary, and the radiative heat flux contributes significantly to the total heating of the combustor wall. Comparison of radiation heat fluxes for different initial conditions are presented.The combustion and flame stabilization modes in a hydrogen fueled scramjet combustor were investigated by experiments and numerical simulations in the present paper. The results were obtained with the inflow conditions of Mach number of 2.0, static temperature of 656.5 K and static pressure of 0.125 MPa, respectively. The combustion mode was scramjet mode when the ER of hydrogen was less than 0.23. When the combustion mode was scramjet mode, the flame stabilization mode was cavity shear layer stabilized combustion, and when the combustion mode was ramjet mode, the flame stabilization mode was combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion.
