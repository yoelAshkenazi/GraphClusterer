The combustion and flame stabilization modes in a hydrogen fueled scramjet combustor were investigated by experiments and numerical simulations in the present paper. The results were obtained with the inflow conditions of Mach number of 2.0, static temperature of 656.5 K and static pressure of 0.125 MPa, respectively. The combustion mode was scramjet mode when the ER of hydrogen was less than 0.23, while it was ramjet mode when the ER of hydrogen was greater than 0.23. When the combustion mode was scramjet mode, the flame stabilization mode was combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion. The flame was unstable and oscillated with the flow during the ramjet-mode operation.Under a contract with NASA, a joint Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM) and NASA team is preparing to conduct the fourth flight test of a dual-mode scramjet aboard the CIAM Hypersonic Flying Laboratory, “Kholod.” Ground-launch, rocket boosted by a modified Russian SA-5 missile, the redesigned scramjet is to be accelerated to a new maximum velocity of Mach 6.5. This should allow for the first-time measurement of the fully supersonic combustion mode..
