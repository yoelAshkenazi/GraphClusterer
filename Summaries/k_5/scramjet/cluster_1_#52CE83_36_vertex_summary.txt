Flow and combustion of a hydrocarbon-air mixture in a channel modeling a section of a supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) are considered. The flow parameters are: Mach number M=2, static pressure Pst=160-250 Torr, stagnation temperature T0=300 K and total air flow rate Gairâ‰¤0.9 kg/s. The third pattern follows a novel approach of a combined mixing/ignition technique, where the electrical discharge is distributed along the fuel jet, starting within the fuel injector. However, due to fuel burnout the channel and flame holder geometry change in the process of scramjet operation, the regression rate being variable both in time and length. The purpose of this work is to develop a computational model of a solid-fuel scramjet taking into account the geometry variation, as well as to obtain typical flow patterns at the different stages of combustion. The numerical model is based on a system of fully compressible RANS equations with k-epsilon turbulence model.Stability of combustion in solid fuel scramjets is contingent upon proper geometry of fuel grain and availability of a flame holder.
