First, in this chapter, smart materials are briefly introduced, followed by a short discussion on the dynamic, reversible stimuli-responsive supramolecular materials. Then the role of the hostâ€“guest complexation in the construction of these materials is evaluated in order to position the CB-containing functional materials in the context of smart materials. The chapter also provides a brief outline of the book with a brief rationale on the arrangement of the chapters.Polybenzoxazines are high-performance thermosets having a range of properties and capability to overcome drawbacks of traditional resole- and novolac-type phenolics. They exhibit low water absorption, high Tg, high char yield, flame resistance, low shrinkage, and also limited or no release of by-products during curing, and they have comparable mechanical performance with bismaleimide resins..
