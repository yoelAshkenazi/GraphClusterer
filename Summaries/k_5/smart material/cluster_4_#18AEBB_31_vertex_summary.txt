“Additive manufacturing (AM)” or “rapid prototyping” is a flourishing technology that has created a vast space in manufacturing industries. Its application zones cover several areas, including the biomedical, aerospace, military, and automotive industries. It can effortlessly produce a complex structure, which is a challenge to the traditional manufacturing systems, and recent progress regarding the 3D printing of smart material is like icing on the cake.. In this review, we first present a discussion of the basics of fiber materials and the design principles of fiber devices, followed by a comprehensive analysis on recently developed fiber devices.. This article utilizes hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the design strategy, which may also be extended to other properties, for example, conductor/insulator, p‐type/n‐type semiconductor, or ferromagnetism/anti‐ferromagnetism, for the design of other BSMI materials in the future.
