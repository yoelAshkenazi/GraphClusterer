Digital technologies in experimental and field studies are considered, the interrelation with mathematical modelling is shown, digital technologies in production of materials, products and structures are presented, the brief analysis of development of computer material science is given. BIM and digital technology in the construction economy are under consideration as well. Paper also explains the concept of so-called "smart" home, "smart" district, "smart" city, "smart" region and "smart" country, which are normally used by smart professionals in terms of current realities, long-term and medium-term prospects. Besides, the expediency of development of design codes in the field of information technologies is assessed.Grating optical chromogenic filter provides angular-selective transmission attenuating direct sunlight and transmitting diffused light. Such a smart window demonstrates more comfortable daylight compared to conventional chromogenic smart window.Currently, developments of the so-called Smart-constructions are relevant as they enable a real-time monitoring of changes in required values. Technologies of creating products from polymer composite materials make it possible to introduce various sensors directly into the structure of a material, thereby create systems monitoring the state of structures.The most recommended for such implementation are fiber-optic sensors, which have a number of advantages over other sensors (luminescent, strain gauge, piezoelectric ones). However, when introducing the fiber-optic sensors, there is a number of difficulties, which are primarily associated with fragility of the optical fiber and lead to the breakdown of fiber-optic lines..
