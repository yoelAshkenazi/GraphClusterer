Abstract An overview is given of the properties of two-dimensional smart photo-, thermo-, and electrochromic materials and devices used for the glazing of buildings and vehicles. It is shown that despite some commercial successes in the creation of materials and devices, further efforts are needed to improve their color neutrality, switching rate, bleached/colored contrast, and durability.Laser processing is a versatile tool that enhances smart materials for diverse industries, allowing precise changes in material properties and customization of surface characteristics. It drives the development of smart materials with adaptive properties through laser modification, utilizing photothermal reactions and functional additives for meticulous control..
