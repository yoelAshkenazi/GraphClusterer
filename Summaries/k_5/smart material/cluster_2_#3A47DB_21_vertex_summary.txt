Stimuli-responsive smart materials that can be prepared by various methods have the ability to sense and respond to various kinds of physical and chemical stimuli in their environment. These materials have many potential applications in fibrous materials in the fields of medicine, protection, security communication, and textile electronics.It’s been almost a decade that the idea of smart materials has attracted man’s attention. These materials are capable of responding to their surrounding environment and of adapting to it. In the present era, simple understanding of the activation mechanisms, the polymer structure, the effect of the modification of the polymer structure on the activation process using fillers or solvents to develop new reliable SMPs with improved properties, long lifetime, fast response, and the ability to apply them under hard conditions in any environment, is considered to be an important topic. Moreover, good understanding of the activation mechanism of the two-way shape memory effect in SMPs for semi-crystalline polymers and liquid crystalline elastomers is the main key required for future investigations.
