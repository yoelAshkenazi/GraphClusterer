Binders, or tackifiers, have become widespread in the production of new composite materials by liquid composite molding (LCM) techniques due to their ability to stabilize preforms during laying-up and impregnation, as well as to improve fracture toughness of the obtained composites, which is very important in aviation, automotive, ship manufacturing, etc. Furthermore, they can be used in modern methods of automatic laying of dry fibers into preforms, which significantly reduces the labor cost of the manufacturing process. In this article, we review the existing research from the 1960s of the 20th century to the present days in the field of creation and properties of binders used to bond various layers of preforms in the manufacturing of composite materials by LCM methods to summarize and synthesize knowledge on these issues..
