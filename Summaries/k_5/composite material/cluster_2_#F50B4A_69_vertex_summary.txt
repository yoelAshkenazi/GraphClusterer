The aim of the work is to study the ways to strengthen the elements of the parametric architecture object framework based on the use of the new materials. The problem of strengthening the elements of the building frame is particularly relevant in connection with the development of the parametric architecture. Unlike the traditional methods of regulation and amplification, composite materials allow to change the stress-strain state and improve the dynamic characteristics of the parametric architecture object without increasing its own structures weight..
