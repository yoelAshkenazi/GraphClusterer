The priority research direction involves creation of cement compositions and technologies that meet the requirements of technological availability and efficiency, environmental safety and sustainability, biocompatibility, economic efficacy and energy and resource saving.The paper proves that these criteria can be affected by material and field impacts on cement systems, which leads to considerable increase in strength of hardened cement paste, mortars and concretes.With this purpose, the paper presents detailed study on combined impact of ultrasound and magnetic field on grouting fluid of cement systems and strength of hardening systems in normal conditions.Compressive strength of cement and sand mortar was found to increase on average by 30-45%.
