To determine the pattern of causalities of Iraqi ballistic missile attacks on Tehran, the capital of Iran, during Iraq-Iran war.Data were extracted from the Army Staff Headquarters based on daily reports of Iranian army units during the war.During 52 days, Tehran was stroked by 118 Al-Hussein missiles (a modified version of Scud missile). Eighty-six missiles landed in populated areas. During 52 days, 8.1 of the civilians died and 30.4 injured daily.Among the remainders, 179 (55.8%) were male and 142 (44.2%) were female.The mean age of the victims was 25.3 years+/-19.9 years.Our results show that the high accuracy of modified Scud missiles landed in crowded areas is the major cause of high mortality in Tehran.The presence of suitable warning system and shelters could reduce civilian casualties.The awareness and readiness of civilian defense forces, rescue services and all medical facilities for dealing with mass casualties caused by ballistic missile attacks are necessary.Guidance and control laws of  anti-tank missile are recorded in a missile subsystem called flight computer. The flying missile diagnoses the right path using these laws(guidance) and gives essential orders according to them to put the missile in its right path(control). like all real systems, the performance of this subsystem may be perturbed by different reasons leading to a derivative of reasonable functions. In this paper, their effects on missile miss distance which is a measurable and appropriate factor is investigated.In order to optimize the geometry of the missile’s crosssection for transportation purposes and also to obtain higher aerodynamic efficiencies, non-circular bodies have gained substantial attention by many researchers.
