The theory of technological uncertainty attributes the destabilizing effect of weapons to the divergence of states' perceptions of the balance of powers, to the hyped expectations regarding the ability to compensate quantitative limitations with qualitative superiority, to the alarmistic sense of closing windows of opportunities and growing vulnerabilities.The article tests the theory against the historical record of military clashes in Europe from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries, as well as the crises between superpowers during the Cold War.The empirical cases are selected in order to cover the period marked by the intensification of qualitative arms races between states.In addition, it is also the period most often used to substantiate the theory of technological uncertainty.All instances of large-scale military clashes were preceded by significant technological changes, while peace fell on periods of technological stagnation.The author addresses the policy implications of the theory for the discussions on emerging weapons in the 2010s and 2020s.The study confirms that concerns regarding their destabilizing effect are justified, but for the different reasons from those put forward by most analysts.A somewhat optimistic caveat to its conclusions is the fact that currently emerging weapons are at various stages of development.The greatest likelihood of military clashes corresponds to the overlap of several technological uncertainties.The article is devoted to the numerical modelling of the force and thermal effects acting on a submarineâ€™s missile silo during an underwater missile launch..
