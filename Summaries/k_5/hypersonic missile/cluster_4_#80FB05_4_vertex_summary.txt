One of the key points for the development of hypersonic airbreathmg propulsion is the mastery of fueled-cooled composite materials structures which are needed for realizing the combustor of a dual-mode ramjet operating up to Mach 8 or more. Very limited activities have been led by EADS France and SNECMA on this subject during the PREPHA program with basic test performed at ONERA. In the same time, EADS France developed a carbon/carbon hydrogen cooled injection strut, which has been successfully tested in CHAMOIS scramjet chamber. By another way, the cooperation led by EADS Aerospatiale Matra Missiles (EADS-AMM) and the Moscow Aviation Institute for developing a fully variable geometry dual mode ramjet was also an opportunity to acquire a large know-how in the field of fuel-cooled structures. Beyond these first steps, EADS-AMM and EADS Launch Vehicles (EADS-LV) are now working on the development of an innovative technology for fueledcooled combustor structures taking advantage of EADS-LV mastery of specific weaving process for manufacturing composite materials..
