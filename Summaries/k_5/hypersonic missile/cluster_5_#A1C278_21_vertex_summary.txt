In this paper, guidance law is selected as desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method. The back-stepping technique is designed and analyzed for the altitude dynamics of hypersonic missile for maneuvering target. Hypersonic missile model is nonlinear, non-minimum phase, uncertain, and highly coupled. Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy estimator is used for estimating the uncertainty of model parameters. The simulation indicates that the proposed scheme has shown effectiveness of the control strategy, high accuracy, stability of states, and low-amplitude control inputs in the presence of uncertainties with external disturbance.To determine the pattern of causalities of Iraqi ballistic missile attacks on Tehran, the capital of Iran, during Iraq-Iran war.Data were extracted from the Army Staff Headquarters based on daily reports of Iranian army units during the war.During 52 days, Tehran was stroked by 118 Al-Hussein missiles (a modified version of Scud missile)..
