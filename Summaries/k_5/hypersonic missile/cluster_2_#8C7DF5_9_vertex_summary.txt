Under a contract with NASA, a joint Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM) and NASA team is preparing to conduct the fourth flight test of a dual-mode scramjet aboard the CIAM Hypersonic Flying Laboratory, “Kholod.” Ground-launch, rocket boosted by a modified Russian SA-5 missile, the redesigned scramjet is to be accelerated to a new maximum velocity of Mach 6.5. This should allow for the first-time measurement of the fully supersonic combustion mode.. Finally, the current project status and schedules to reach the final flight launch are discussed.Under a contract with NASA, a joint Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM) and NASA team recently conducted the fourth flight test of a dual-mode scramjet aboard the CIAM Hypersonic Flying Laboratory, 'Kholod'. With an aim test Mach 6.5 objective, the successful launch was conducted at the Sary Shagan test range in central Kazakstan on February 12, 1998..
