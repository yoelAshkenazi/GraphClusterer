A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation.High-speed trains experience a sharp transition to a strong crosswind environment when running in a bridge–tunnel section due to the perennial prevailing crosswind in the canyon, and this sudden transition seriously affects train safety.In this study, a 3D computational fluid dynamics numerical model of the train–tunnel–bridge–wind barrier is established based on the delayed detached eddy simulation turbulence model and porous media theory.A dynamic analysis model of wind–train–bridge coupling is adopted.The effects of wind barrier with a height of 3 ​m and porosity of 30% on the aerodynamic coefficient, flow field structure and running safety of high-speed trains under crosswind in the bridge–tunnel section are studied.Results indicate that the sharp change effect of the aerodynamic coefficient is significantly weakened by more than 50% by the wind barrier.The aerodynamic fluctuation amplitudes in the bridge–tunnel section are 1.25–5.5 times higher than those in the bridge section.The vertical profiles of wind speed within the wind-tunnel vegetation exhibited a deflection which was not reflected within the multi-row windbreak where profiles were nearly uniform without inflections, which was likely a response to different plant spacing and patterns.Lowest wind speeds were observed beyond the wind-tunnel canopies and at the beginning of the windbreak.No difference in the size of the sheltered zone is observed between the two plant types in the wind tunnel either in different wind velocities or in various density configurations, or within the windbreak in various wind speeds and different dust storm events.The sheltered area was greater for the windbreak than for the wind-tunnel canopies, suggesting that wind tunnel studies may under-estimate the sheltered area afforded by a multi-row windbreak..
