The theoretical and experimental results are presented which relate to flows over such simple bodies as a semisphere, a wedge, and a cone investigated in hypersonic wind tunnels of various classes at similar Mach and Reynolds numbers (M=7.0 to 8.0; Re/sub o//spl sime/135 to 210) and at different air flow velocities (790/sup msub s/, 2700/sup msub s/ and 6000/sup msub s/). Hypersonic resistor-type and arc-heating wind tunnels and a hypervelocity MHD-air acceleration wind tunnel, as well as their test equipment are described..
