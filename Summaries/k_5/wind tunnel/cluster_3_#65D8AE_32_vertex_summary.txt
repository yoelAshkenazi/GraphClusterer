Novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation. The tunnel is evaluated and characterized using sucking fan which is placed at the front end to simulate available wind in the atmosphere. A wind turbine is placed at the back end of the tunnel to generate electricity. The tunnel structure is made up from galvanized aluminum with square front and back ends with side length of 0.75 m and 0.5 m, respectively. The elevation of the tunnel measured from center to center of the front end and back end is 1.5 m. The used wind turbine in the tunnel has 48 cm diameter blades made up from aluminum..
