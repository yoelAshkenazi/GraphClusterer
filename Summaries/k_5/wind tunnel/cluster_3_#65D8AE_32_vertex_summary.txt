A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation. A sucking fan is placed at the wind tunnel front end to simulate wind in the atmosphere and a wind turbine is placed at the backend of the wind tunnel to generate electricity. The wind turbine uses 48 cm diameter blades made from aluminum. The wind tunnel is made up from galvanized aluminum with square front and back ends with side length of 0.75 m and 0.5 m, respectively. The results of the study show that the wind tunnel can be used as a passive wind tunnel for the generation of electricity.. The results of experimental studies in the wind tunnel and mathematical analysis of the impact of interaction of individual structural components on the wind turbine output characteristics are reported, and recommendations on the choice of x design parameters of wind turbines to improve energy performance are elaborated.Description both mobile and stationary multifunction set of optical research equipment created for investigations in wind tunnel are presented.Experimental wind tunnel and smoke visualization testing was conducted to investigate the performance of a two-sided wind catcher. This type of wind catcher is divided internally into two halves for the purposes of air supply and extract. In this study, the two-sided wind catcher model was constructed of two similar one-sided wind catcher models, which were attached back to back.
