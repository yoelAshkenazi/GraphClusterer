Stagnation pressure fields and heat fluxes in two short-duration wind tunnels, UT-1M Ludwig-type shock wind tunnel (M = 6 and 8) and IT-2M hot-shot wind tunnel (M = 12 and 20) are studied experimentally and numerically.Results of the tests of aerodynamic stability of arched bridge in specialized wind tunnel are presented in this work. Atmospheric boundary layer properties were modeled in Landscape Wind tunnel of Krylov State Research Center to take into account wind characteristics â€“ changing of mean wind velocity with height, turbulence intensity and spectrums..
