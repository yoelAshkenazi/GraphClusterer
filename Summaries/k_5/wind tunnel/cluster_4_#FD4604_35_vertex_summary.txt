At present experimental gas-dynamic studies of supersonic flows mainly use complex experimental facilities, such as aerodynamic wind tunnels and shock tubes. However, in order to study supersonic flows with Mach numbers M < 4, a vacuum wind tunnel (which is much simpler) can also be used. This paper is concerned with starting processes occurring in a vacuum wind tunnel.A review of foreign and Russian sources is given mentioning the pioneering wind tunnels built in Russia at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries. The first wind tunnel in Russia was constructed by V.A. Pashkevich at the Mikhailovsky Artillery Academy in St. Petersburg in 1871. Schemes, photographs, formulas, description of the research and test results taken from the original papers published by the wind tunnel designers are given.The paper describes the algorithm of the flow parameters calculation for hypersonic wind tunnels taking into account the real gas properties using air and carbon dioxide as a working gas.The results of the experimental measurements of the flow velocity at the contoured nozzle exit in the hypersonic wind tunnel IT-302M have been carried out for verification of the algorithm.The application of luminescent sensor paint for quantitative pressure measurement on the surface of an aircraft model in wind tunnels is discussed..
