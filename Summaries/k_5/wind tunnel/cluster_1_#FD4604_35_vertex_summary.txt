Results of the tests of aerodynamic stability of arched bridge in specialized wind tunnel are presented in this work.Various ways of increasing the Reynolds number, Re, in hypersonic wind tunnels were considered.The flow in a virtual wind tunnel with a geometry corresponding to the actual IT-302M hot-shot wind tunnel was considered. CFD simulations were made for the initial conditions taken from the experiment. The flow model from a closed volume through a porous insert simulates the start-up process of the IT-302M installation with good accuracy; the boundary condition in the form of a constant temperature makes it possible to obtain data close to the results of solving the conjugate heat transfer problem.The activities described in the paper are aimed at studying flow characteristics in the T-128 wind tunnel..
