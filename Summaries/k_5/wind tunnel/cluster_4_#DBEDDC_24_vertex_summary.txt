Abstract Determination of the high potential of dust emission is a requisite affair in the management of dusts emission and as well as avoiding its risks. Wind tunnel is among the most important approaches in the study of areas having high potential in emitting dusts. Extensive dried playas and desert areas require the making of low-cost, simple, and car-portable tunnels capable of presenting comparable data of various areas even supposing not having enough precision in the model of real wind motion. In this study, we first engaged in making a car-portable tunnel with a primarily semicircle section of 38 cm height, 50 cm diameter, and 110 cm length. Several perforated walls are designed, manufactured, and installed on the top and bottom sides of the test section. The flow in the test section of the wind tunnel is surveyed for the empty condition prior to testing models. Once satisfactory results regarding the flow quality requirements in the test section under various conditions were achieved, a 2D model, NACA 0012, and a 3D standard model for the transonic wind tunnels, AGARD-B, are manufactured and tested under various conditions for the purpose of integral calibration and validation of the tunnel data.
