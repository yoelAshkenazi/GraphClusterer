The research shows that the real aerial weapon, i.e. hypersonic missile warhead and the target simulator of the MALD type, in bistatic radar result in significantly different topological scattering patterns when taking into account the radiation polarization. Radiation with p -polarization allows for a more expressive topological scattering pattern than in the case of s -polarization, and the Î¸ angle change of the place gives a brighter relief pattern with alternating maxima and deep minima, which leads to an assumption about a high resolving power when identifying the objects by means of the gradient method. A special difference between the two objects, i.e. the target simulator and the missile warhead, can be observed in the case of s -polarization: the patterns differ significantly in topology, the missile maxima regions occupy a larger area, while the minima are much deeper.The article analyzes a number of destructive factors that cause objective difficulties in the examination of the crime scene in the areas of armed conflict, including in the process of investigating war crimes committed by the opposing sides of an armed conflict with the use of missile-artillery and aerial missile-bomb weapons. These difficulties are primarily connected with the committing crimes by representatives of the opposing side of the armed conflict, their obstruction of the activities of military justice bodies, including by mining the area, the use of small arms, mortar and missile-artillery weapons, the presence of significant casualties and destruction, which generally complicates the examination of the scene.
