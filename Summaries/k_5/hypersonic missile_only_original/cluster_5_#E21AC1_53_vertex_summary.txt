The article introduces the results of studying the designs of warheads of anti-aircraft guided missiles. Warheads of V-300 anti-aircraft missile system were taken as an example. The analysis of information from open sources allowed restoring the design and layout of the warheads and assessing their combat characteristics, which made it possible to explore different types of warheads and identify their common design features. In addition, a wide range of warheads of V-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles demonstrates the general patterns of their development in terms of the evolution of the warheads of anti-aircraft guided missiles as a special type of ammunition..
