In this paper, for simplification and better understanding, simplified model of 2 radars and 2 missiles engagement in three time steps is investigated at first, In which, it is assumed that radars are not turned on and off simultaneously, and the missiles do not attack the same radar at the same time. Then, model of 2 radars and 2 missiles engagement in three time steps with elimination of aforementioned assumptions is considered, and the simulation results are provided and investigated. Finally, the general form of MIMO Radar and ARM Missiles engagement modeling (r number of radars and m number of missiles) in n time steps, using game theory is investigated and discussed. In this general form investigation, the influence of time step enhancement, radar enhancement, and missile enhancement on the modelling is addressed, separately. In this paper, MATLAB software is utilized for the system modeling and simulation.
