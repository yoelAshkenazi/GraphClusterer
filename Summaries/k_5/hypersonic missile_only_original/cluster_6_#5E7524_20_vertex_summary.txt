In this paper, guidance law is selected as desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method. The back-stepping technique is designed and analyzed for the altitude dynamics of hypersonic missile for maneuvering target. Hypersonic missile model is nonlinear, non-minimum phase, uncertain, and highly coupled.In this paper, we propose a back-stepping controller scheme for the altitude subsystem of hypersonic missile of which model is nonlinear, non-minimum phase, uncertain, and highly coupled. In the scheme, the guidance law is selected as a desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method..
