The mathematical model includes equations of gas dynamics, equations of the turbulence model and equations of chemical kinetics. A critical review of the various models that are used to find the stand-off distance is provided. The results of numerical calculations on the distribution of flow quantities in the shock layer and the stand-off distance at different freestream Mach numbers are presented. The results of numerical calculations in a wide range of freestream Mach numbers are compared with the experimental data and computational results of other researchers.. We conclude that a 1,000 kilometer‚Äêrange missile with a one tonne payload could be built using Scud technology.The article tests the theory against the historical record of military clashes in Europe from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries, as well as the crises between superpowers during the Cold War.The empirical cases are selected in order to cover the period marked by the intensification of qualitative arms races between states.In addition, it is also the period most often used to substantiate the offense-defense balance theory.The theory of technological uncertainty attributes the destabilizing effect of weapons to the divergence of states' perceptions of the balance of powers, to the hyped expectations regarding the ability to compensate quantitative limitations with qualitative superiority, to the alarmistic sense of closing windows of opportunities and growing vulnerabilities.The article tests the theory against the historical record of military clashes in Europe from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries, as well as the crises between superpowers during the Cold War.The empirical cases are selected in order to cover the period marked by the intensification of qualitative arms races between states.In addition, it is also the period most often used to substantiate the offense-defense balance theory.The theory of technological uncertainty attributes the destabilizing effect of weapons to the divergence of states' perceptions of the balance of powers, to the hyped expectations regarding the ability to compensate quantitative limitations with qualitative superiority, to the alarmistic sense of closing windows of opportunities and growing vulnerabilities.The article tests the theory against the historical record of military clashes in Europe from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries, as well as the crises between superpowers during the Cold War.The theory of technological uncertainty attributes the destabilizing effect of weapons to the divergence of states' perceptions of the balance of powers, to the hyped expectations regarding the ability to compensate quantitative limitations with qualitative superiority, to the alarmistic sense of closing windows of opportunities and growing vulnerabilities.
