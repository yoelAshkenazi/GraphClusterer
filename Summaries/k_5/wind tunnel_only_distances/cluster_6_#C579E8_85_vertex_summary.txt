A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation. A sucking fan is placed at the wind tunnel front end to simulate wind in the atmosphere and a wind turbine is placed at the backend of the wind tunnel to generate electricity. The wind tunnel is made up from galvanized aluminum with square front and back ends with side length of 0.75 m and 0.5 m, respectively. The vertical profiles of wind speed within the wind-tunnel vegetation exhibited a deflection which was not reflected within the multi-row windbreak where profiles were nearly uniform without inflections, which was likely a response to different plant spacing and patterns..
