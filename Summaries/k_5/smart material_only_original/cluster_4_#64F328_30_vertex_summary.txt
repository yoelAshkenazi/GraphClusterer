“Additive manufacturing (AM)” or “rapid prototyping” is a flourishing technology that has created a vast space in manufacturing industries. Its application zones cover several areas, including the biomedical, aerospace, military, and automotive industries.Bioinspired materials capable of driving liquid in a directional manner have wide potential applications in many chemical engineering processes, such as heat transfer, separation, microfluidics, and so on. Numerous natural materials and systems such as spider silk, cactus, shorebirds, desert beetles, butterfly wing, and Nepenthes alata have been serving as a rich source of inspirations in the area.In recent years, smart interfacial materials that can reversibly transit between the superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity have aroused much attention. However, all present performances happen in air, and to realize such a smart transition in complex environments, such as oil, is still a challenge.Herein, TiO2 nanotube arrays with switchable transition between the superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity in oil are reported.The switching can be observed by alternation of UV irradiation and heating process, and the smart controllability can be ascribed to the cooperative effect between the surface nanostructures and the chemical composition variation.By using the controllable wetting performances, some applications such as under-oil droplet-based microreaction and water-removal from oil were demonstrated on our surface.This paper reports a surface with smart water wettability in oil, which could start some fresh ideas for wetting control on interfacial materials..
