Stimuli-responsive smart materials that can be prepared by various methods have the ability to sense and respond to various kinds of physical and chemical stimuli in their environment. These materials have many potential applications in fibrous materials in the fields of medicine, protection, security communication, and textile electronics.Using, fabricating, and researching in the subject of the smart materials had incredible progress in the last decade. Like other materials, the smart behaviors have been created in the epoxy and its composites. The shape memory epoxy with capability to recover its initial form is one of the smart behaviors in the epoxy composites, which can be used in the electronic devices or wind turbines. The extrinsic or intrinsic self-healing composites are the other smart group of epoxy-based composites, which will be capable to use in the composite structures like aircraft parts..
