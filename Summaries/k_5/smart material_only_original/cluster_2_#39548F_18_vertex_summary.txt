Abstract Stimuli‐responsive or smart materials have recently shown a significant impact on the frontier of material science and engineering. The exponential development of synthetic host molecules (SHMs) over the last decades and their corresponding host–guest chemistry, have empowered researchers with new opportunities to design and construct tailored or guest‐specific smart materials. In this Minireview, we present the recent advancements in synthetic host based smart materials, ranging from the fabrication strategies to the state‐of‐art applications including adsorption, separation, luminescence, self‐healing and actuation. The role that the host–guest chemistry plays in these systems is highlighted throughout to give a better prospective of the available possibilities for emerging materials of future economies. Recently, a novel type of PPHs based on intramolecular biorthogonal photo-click reaction developed by our group has been demonstrated with relative mechanism and applications..
