Hard tissue repair and regeneration cost hundreds of billions of dollars annually worldwide, and the need has substantially increased as the population has aged. The smart material-based approaches include smart scaffolds and stem cell constructs for bone tissue engineering; smart drug delivery systems to enhance bone regeneration; smart dental resins that respond to pH to protect tooth structures; smart polymers to modulate biofilm species away from a pathogenic composition and shift towards a healthy composition; and smart materials to suppress biofilms and avoid drug resistance. These smart biomaterials can not only deliver and guide stem cells to improve tissue regeneration and deliver drugs and bioactive agents with spatially and temporarily controlled releases but can also modulate/suppress biofilms and combat infections in wound sites. The new generation of smart biomaterials provides exciting potential and is a promising opportunity to substantially enhance hard tissue engineering and regenerative medicine efficacy.Traditional printed products have to some extent affected the development of smart structures and their application in multiple fields, especially in harsh environments, due to their complex mechanisms and control principles. The 4D printing technology based on magnetically controlled smart materials exploits the advantages of magnetically controlled smart materials with good operability and security, and its printed smart structures can be obtained under magnetic field drive for unfettered remote manipulation and wireless motion control, which expands the application of printed products in complex environments, such as sealed and narrow, and has broad development prospects..
