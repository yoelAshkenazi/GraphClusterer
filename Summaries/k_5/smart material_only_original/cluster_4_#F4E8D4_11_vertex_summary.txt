Traditional printed products have to some extent affected the development of smart structures and their application in multiple fields, especially in harsh environments, due to their complex mechanisms and control principles. The 4D printing technology based on magnetically controlled smart materials exploits the advantages of magnetically controlled smart materials with good operability and security, and its printed smart structures can be obtained under magnetic field drive for unfettered remote manipulation and wireless motion control, which expands the application of printed products in complex environments, such as sealed and narrow, and has broad development prospects. At present, magnetically controlled smart material 4D printing technology is still in its infancy, and its theory and application need further inâ€“depth study..
