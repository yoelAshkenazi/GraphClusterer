“Additive manufacturing (AM)” or “rapid prototyping” is a flourishing technology that has created a vast space in manufacturing industries. Its application zones cover several areas, including the biomedical, aerospace, military, and automotive industries. It can effortlessly produce a complex structure, which is a challenge to the traditional manufacturing systems, and recent progress regarding the 3D printing of smart material is like icing on the cake.Abstract Controlling the surface chemical and physical properties of materials and modulating the interfacial behaviors of biological entities, e.g., cells and biomolecules, are central tasks in the study of biomaterials..
