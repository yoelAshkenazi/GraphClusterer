This paper describes an active vibration isolation platform based on active dampers using the "smart" magnetorheological(MR) elastomers. These composite "smart" materials are a new type of magnetoactive material.The properties of such materials can be quickly and reversibly changed by applying the external magnetic fields.This work focused on the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the active damper based on MR elastomers.Grating optical chromogenic filter provides angular-selective transmission attenuating direct sunlight and transmitting diffused light.Such a smart window demonstrates more comfortable daylight compared to conventional chromogenic smart window.Currently, developments of the so-called Smart-constructions are relevant as they enable a real-time monitoring of changes in required values.The most promising of these new window technologies, called smart windows, are electrochromic, thermochromic, and photochromic windows.This study aims to evaluate the energy performances of smart windows and reveal their advantages and disadvantages over the available window system in this climate condition.In this context, smart window systems have been classified and explained their properties.In the simulation part, a reference office building has been modeled with each smart window system to evaluate their energy performances comparatively.For a more detailed analysis of using the fiber-optic sensors and various configurations of the Smart-layer, the corresponding loads were simulated to assess their mechanical behavior.Based on the obtained physical and mechanical characteristics, a specific configuration of the Smart-layer was selected and justified for further researches.
