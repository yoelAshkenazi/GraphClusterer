What is 3D printing? Potential future economic implications of 3D printing. 3D companies.3D printing is called as desktop fabrication. It is a process of prototyping where by a structure is synthesized from a 3d model. The 3d model is stored in as a STL format and after that forwarded to a 3D printer.3D printing is a rapidly developing and cost optimized form of rapid prototyping.The 3D printer prints the CAD design layer by layer forming a real object. 3D printing process is derived from inkjet desktop printers in which multiple deposit jets and the printing material, layer by layer derived from the CAD 3D data.3D printing significantly challenges mass production processes in the future..
