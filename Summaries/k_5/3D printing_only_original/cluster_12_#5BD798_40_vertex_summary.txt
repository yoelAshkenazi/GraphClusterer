Abstract 3D printing has been extensively used for rapid prototyping as well as low-volume production in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries. However, conventional manufacturing processes (i.e., injection molding and CNC machining) are more economical than 3D printing for high-volume mass production. In addition, current 3D printing techniques are not capable of fabricating large components due to the limited build size of commercially available 3D printers. To increase 3D printing throughput and build volume, a novel cooperative 3D printing technique has been recently introduced..
