Abstract 3D printing technology is gradually used in the field of stomatology, such as repair, planting, orthodontics and other disciplines. 3D printing process mainly includes four aspects: oral scanning, Digital design, 3D printing materials and 3D printing technology and equipment. The properties of 3D printing materials are the key factors affecting the effect of 3D printing.There were no significant difference in ASD size parameters among 3D printing models, 2D-TEE and 3D-TEE images(all P>0.05), the ASD size parameters were concordant well between 3D printing models and 2D-TEE or 3D-TEE images. Moreover, the absolute difference value of ASD size parameters between 3D printing models and 2D-TEE or 3D-TEE images were little. In addition, linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation in the Dmax measured from 3D printing models and the sizes of occulder used in the operation (r=0.94, P<0.05). In the ASD 3D printing models the preoperative exercise had an impressive effect.
