Taking microfluidics as the object, considering the advances of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, this chapter aims to explore the integration between microfluidics and 3D printing: microfluidic nozzles in 3D printing, 3D printing of microfluidic chips, and in situ 3D printing on microfluidic chips.First, the focus is placed on the application of microfluidic devices as nozzles for microdroplet generation, multimaterial mixing and patterning in 3D printing.Second, targeting at polydimethylsiloxane, paper, and hydrogel materials, the involvement of 3D printing in microfluidic chips construction is introduced.Third, in situ 3D printing on microfluidic chips is explored to obtain functional reaction models.In particular, the application of 3D-printed microfluidics in the fields of biomedicine and chemistry is highlighted, including the reagents reaction and analysis, physiology and disease modeling, as well as point-of-care.Finally, the unique merits, current limitations, and future trends of the technical integration of 3D printing and microfluidics are presented..
