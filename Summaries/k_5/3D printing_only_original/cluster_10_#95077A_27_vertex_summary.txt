This is a review paper on 3D printing and the various materials used in 3D printing and their properties which become a notable topic in technological aspects. First, define what is meant by 3D printing and what is significant of 3D printing.In recent years, the potential applications of three-dimensional (3D) food printing have emphasized this technique's prospects. This chapter details a brief history of 3D printing and a description of 3D printing options for food. It focuses on hydrocolloids in the 3D printing process, with a mention of their use to control the texture of 3D-printed foods.3D printing id the process in which the material get deposited layer by layer to manufacture the product. In 3D printing fused deposition, modelling is the process mainly used for the manufacturing of the polymer component. The surface finish of the 3D printed component depends on the different input parameters, therefore it is necessary to review the 3D printing process.Three-dimensional printing can be successfully applied in the food sector to fabricate 3D foods with complex geometries, customized texture, and tailored nutritional contents..
