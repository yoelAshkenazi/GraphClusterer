There is a large somatosensory gap between the three-dimensional (3D) printing of clothing and traditional garments due to the limitations (e.g., air permeability and skin-friendliness) of the printing materials. For this reason, the application of traditional textile materials in 3D printing has become a hot topic in the field of 3D printed clothing. Based on the above, this work prepared four kinds of cotton-containing composite solutions and then impregnated thermoplastic polyurethane core yarns in these solutions to obtain four types of 3D printed cotton-containing composite core yarns (3Dp-C-CYs). Afterward, based on the two-dimensional (2D) braiding method, four kinds of cotton-containing 3D printing wires used for fused deposition molding technology were prepared by wrapping low-melting polyester filaments around the different 3Dp-C-CYs. After comparing the printing performance of the four cotton-containing 3D printing wires, the wire containing cotton powders had the best comprehensive performance and was selected to print the cotton-containing 3D printed fabrics..
