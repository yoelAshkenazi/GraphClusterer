3D printing is now recognized as a significant tool for medical research and clinical practice, leading to the emergence of medical 3D printing technology. It is essential to improve the properties of 3D-printed products to meet the demand for medical use.The core of generating qualified 3D printing products is to develop advanced materials and processes.Taking advantage of nanomaterials with tunable and distinct physical, chemical, and biological properties, integrating nanotechnology into 3D printing creates new opportunities for advancing medical 3D printing field.Recently, some attempts are made to improve medical 3D printing through nanotechnology, providing new insights into developing advanced medical 3D printing technology.This paper reviews the recent development of 3D printing of biosamples, in terms of the 3D structure design, suitable printing technology, and available materials.Successfully printed 3D biosamples should possess the properties of high cell viability, vascularization and good biocompatibility.These goals are attained by printing the materials of hydrogels, polymers and cells, with a carefully selected 3D printer from the categories of inkjet printing, extrusion printing and laser printing, based on the uniqueness, advantages and disadvantages of these technologies.For recent developments, we introduce the 3D applications of creating scaffolds, printing cells for self-assembly and testing platforms.We foresee more bio-applications of 3D printing will be developed, with the advancements on materials and 3D printing machines..
