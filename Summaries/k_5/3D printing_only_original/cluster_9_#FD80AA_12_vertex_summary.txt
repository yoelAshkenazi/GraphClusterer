Abstract 3D printing has been extensively used for rapid prototyping as well as low-volume production in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries. However, conventional manufacturing processes (i.e., injection molding and CNC machining) are more economical than 3D printing for high-volume mass production.Although existing energy storage devices (ESDs) that are prepared by traditional technologies can meet the demands of many application scenarios in our life, there are still many special application scenarios that cannot be implemented, such as flexible devices, wearable devices, and structural devices.Since a three-dimensional (3D) printed drug was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, there has been a growing interest in 3D printing for drug manufacturing. There are multiple 3D printing methods - including selective laser sintering, binder deposition, stereolithography, inkjet printing, extrusion-based printing, and fused deposition modeling - which are compatible with printing drug products, in addition to both polymer filaments and hydrogels as materials for drug carriers..
