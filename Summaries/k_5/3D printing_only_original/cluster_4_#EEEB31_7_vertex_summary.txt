As a rapid prototyping technology, 3D printing has become one of the key technologies as the adsorption forming strategy due to the diversity and convenience in structural design. More importantly, 3D printing can optimize the mass and heat transfer processes during adsorption by manipulating the structure of 3D-printed adsorbents. In the preparation of 3D-printed monolithic adsorbents, the properties of materials are the key factors in the 3D printing process..
