3D printing technology has become increasingly popular in healthcare settings, with applications of 3D printed anatomical models ranging from diagnostics and surgical planning to patient education. However, as the use of 3D printed anatomical models becomes more widespread, there is a growing need for regulation and quality control to ensure their accuracy and safety.BackgroundA comprehensive knowledge of mitral valve (MV) anatomy is crucial in the assessment of MV disease.MethodsA prototype method for MV 3D modelling and printing was developed from computed tomography (CT) scans of a plastinated human heart. Mitral valve models were printed using four 3D printing methods and validated to assess precision.D echocardiography imaging data of four MV disease patients was used to produce patient-specific 3D printed models, and 40 cardiac health professionals (CHPs) were surveyed on the perceived value and potential uses of 3D models in a clinical setting.ResultsThe prototype method demonstrated submillimetre precision for all four 3D printing methods used, and statistical analysis showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in precision between these methods..
