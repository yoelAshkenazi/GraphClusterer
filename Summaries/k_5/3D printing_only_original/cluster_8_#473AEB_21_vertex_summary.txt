Abstract 3D printing technology is gradually used in the field of stomatology, such as repair, planting, orthodontics and other disciplines. 3D printing process mainly includes four aspects: oral scanning, Digital design, 3D printing materials and 3D printing technology and equipment.The properties of 3D printing materials are the key factors affecting the effect of 3D printing. This paper reviews the research and development of 3D printing materials in stomatology at home and abroad in recent years and prospects the future development of 3D printing materials in that field.One of the most active areas of research today is 3D printing technology. Since the 1980s, the development of 3D printing technology has aroused interest worldwide and has begun to influence peopleâ€™s thinking and way of life. Today, 3D printing technology has advanced and is used in many different fields such as aerospace, military and academia..
