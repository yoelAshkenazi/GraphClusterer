Abstract 3D printing technology is gradually used in the field of stomatology, such as repair, planting, orthodontics and other disciplines. 3D printing process mainly includes four aspects: oral scanning, Digital design, 3D printing materials and 3D printing technology and equipment. The properties of 3D printing materials are the key factors affecting the effect of 3D printing. This paper reviews the research and development of 3D printing materials in stomatology at home and abroad in recent years and prospects the future development of 3D printing materials in that field.Taking microfluidics as the object, considering the advances of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, this chapter aims to explore the integration between microfluidics and 3D printing: microfluidic nozzles in 3D printing, 3D printing of microfluidic chips, and in situ 3D printing on microfluidic chips..
