3D printing allows decentralization and localized production of foods when food printing enters into business trade with the globalization of 3D-printed foods. However, only very few reports are available on the safety of 3D-printed foods. In this regard, the present chapter mainly discusses the safety aspects of 3D-printed foods, challenges, and research needs. Consumers have the right to know about the source and origin of food ingredients which cannot be overviewed when it comes to 3D-printed foods. Even though 3D printing delivers foods based on localized demand, it is crucial to provide proper labeling of 3D-printed foods. The storage stability of 3D-printed foods is equally important as that of the optimization of printability. The present chapter envisages the practical challenges associated with the safety of 3D-printed foods and highlights a future outlook on measures to be undertaken in overcoming safety concerns to explore 3D food printing at the commercial level.The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has launched the NIH 3D Print Exchange, an online portal for discovering and creating bioscientifically relevant 3D models suitable for 3D printing, to provide both researchers and educators with a trusted source to discover accurate and informative models.
