One of the most active areas of research today is 3D printing technology.Since the 1980s, the development of 3D printing technology has aroused interest worldwide and has begun to influence people’s thinking and way of life. Today, 3D printing technology has advanced and is used in many different fields such as aerospace, military and academia. Although the term “3D printing” is widely known, few are familiar with its basic principles. However, numerous studies have shown that mass production 3D printing is not yet feasible. There are not many ways to mass-produce 3D printed products.This article will summarize the current development status of 3D printing technology from the status of 3D printing technology, the classification of 3D printing technology, and look forward to its future development prospects. Through the research of this paper, it will provide a certain reference for the future development of 3D printing technology.As a rapid prototyping technology, 3D printing has become one of the key technologies as the adsorption forming strategy due to the diversity and convenience in structural design. More importantly, 3D printing can optimize the mass and heat transfer processes during adsorption by manipulating the structure of 3D-printed adsorbents. In the preparation of 3D-printed monolithic adsorbents, the properties of materials are the key factors in the 3D printing process.
