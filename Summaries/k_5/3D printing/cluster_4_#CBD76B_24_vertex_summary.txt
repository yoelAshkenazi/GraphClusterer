Taking microfluidics as the object, considering the advances of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, this chapter aims to explore the integration between microfluidics and 3D printing: microfluidic nozzles in 3D printing, 3D printing of microfluidic chips, and in situ 3D printing on microfluidic chips.ResultsThe prototype method demonstrated submillimetre precision for all four 3D printing methods used, and statistical analysis showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in precision between these methods. Patient-specific 3D printed models, particularly using multiple print materials, were considered useful by CHPs for preoperative planning, as well as other applications such as teaching and training.ConclusionsThis study suggests that, with further advances in 3D modelling and printing technology, patient-specific 3D MV models could serve as a useful clinical tool.The findings also highlight the potential of this technology to be applied in a variety of medical areas within both clinical and educational settings..
