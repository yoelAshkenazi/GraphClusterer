One of the most active areas of research today is 3D printing technology. Since the 1980s, the development of 3D printing technology has aroused interest worldwide and has begun to influence peopleâ€™s thinking and way of life. Today, 3D printing technology has advanced and is used in many different fields such as aerospace, military and academia.Although existing energy storage devices (ESDs) that are prepared by traditional technologies can meet the demands of many application scenarios in our life, there are still many special application scenarios that cannot be implemented, such as flexible devices, wearable devices, and structural devices.There is a large somatosensory gap between the three-dimensional (3D) printing of clothing and traditional garments due to the limitations (e.g., air permeability and skin-friendliness) of the printing materials. For this reason, the application of traditional textile materials in 3D printing has become a hot topic in the field of 3D printed clothing..
