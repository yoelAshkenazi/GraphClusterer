Let us consider textile composite materials which are most widely used in structures working under high temperatures.The six-level structure for a textile composite material is considered, and mathematical models and calculation methods for mechanical and thermal properties of textile composites are suggested. Computed results and corresponding experimental data are shown for different types of matrices and fibres of composites under heating with different rates (up to 3000 K). In addition, the following types of destruction of textile composites at normal and high temperatures are described: the breakage of fabric threads laid in one of the reinforcing directions; the loss of stability of threads laid in one of the reinforcing directions; delamination of a composite; cracking under transverse compression. The corresponding failure criteria are suggested.The aim of the work is to study the ways to strengthen the elements of the parametric architecture object framework based on the use of the new materials..
