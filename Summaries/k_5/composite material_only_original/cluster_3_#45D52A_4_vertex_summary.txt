This chapter focus on the synthesisSynthesis, analysis and modeling of composite materialsComposite materials used in ballistic applicationsBallistic applications. In this context, a brief introduction is made on the summary of ballisticsBallistics and threat typesThreat types in personal ballisticsBallistics. The main components of the compositesComposite including fiberFiber types and fabric structuresFabric structures are described in detail. Then, the ballistic impact mechanismsBallistic impact mechanisms for textile and composite materialsComposite materials are discussed with failureFailure mechanisms that occurred in the ballistic testsBallistic test. Additionally, numerical simulationNumerical simulation techniques and material models for ballisticBallistics fabrics and compositeComposite structuresStructure are presented with corresponding literature published in the last five years. Finally, final trends such as bio-inspired structuresStructure and adding novel soft energyEnergy absorbing materials into the ballisticBallistics structuresStructure are exemplarily offered..
