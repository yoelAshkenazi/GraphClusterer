Abstract Composite material for medical application on the basis of polydimethylsiloxane rubber (PDMS) and graphite was obtained. The physico‐chemical and mechanical properties of the material depending on the quantity, purity of the modifier and its preliminary treatment were studied. The established physico‐chemical properties of the material surface allow to make the preliminary prediction of its thromboresistance.A new composite material for use in optical molecular oxygen sensors is proposed. The absence of pores on the surface of the material avoids microbiological fouling and concomitant deterioration of the characteristics with time, and the presence of the mesoporous phase results in a linear calibration and acceptable response times, even for layers that are significant in thickness.Abstract The article presents the results of processing a number of compositions of composite materials sustained under cyclic temperature changes, as well as changes in humidity and positive temperatures.
