Abstract An analytical method for predicting characteristics of building composite materials is proposed. It is based on the properties of their components and on the following key assumptions: characteristics of a composite on the contact surfaces of the matrix and the filler are not worse than the parameters of any of the components of the material; the properties of the matrix are taken as isotropic and equal over the whole volume of the environment that is provided by the technology of preparation of mixtures; the filler of the composite consists of particles-grains which size is so small that their properties can be considered isotropic, however, the particles are still not nanoscale; the material as a whole and its components obey the Hooke's law and the rule of mixtures until the destruction of any part of the composite; the elastic stage of the work material is reviewed..
