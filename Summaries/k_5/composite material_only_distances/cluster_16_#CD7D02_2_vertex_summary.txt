Abstract The generic printing materials based on the filament with the proper unique properties In recent years 3-D technology has become one of mostly used prototype methods for various applications. 3-d printing technology was now adopted in many areas of research and development sectors these technology was increasing the demand of improvement and this properties of verifying and by blending the materials exhibited using varies properties to for manufacturing high performance composites. In day-to-day-life composites have already utilized as a wide range of applications which included in manufacturing of the biomedical components, mechanical components and electrical. The 3-D printed composites were manufactured till the ability range of manufacturing complex-shapes and the geo-metrical shapes in the low cost production and the advantages in the prototypes this review causes all the recent developments, reports and properties of developing the 3-D printable materials have been modifies either by the nano-particles, fibres and other polymers in the field of mechanical and electrical sectors.
