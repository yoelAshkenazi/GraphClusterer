Abstract An analytical method for predicting characteristics of building composite materials is proposed. It is based on the properties of their components and on the following key assumptions: characteristics of a composite on the contact surfaces of the matrix and the filler are not worse than the parameters of any of the components of the material; the properties of the matrix are taken as isotropic and equal over the whole volume of the environment that is provided by the technology of preparation of mixtures; the filler of the composite consists of particles which size is so small that their properties can be considered isotropic, however, the particles are still not nanoscale; the material as a whole and its components obey the Hooke's law and the rule of mixtures until the destruction of any part of the composite; the elastic stage of the work material is reviewed. The approach is more close to the experimental values of the ultimate strength and elastic modulus of the material than other techniques.A new methodology for research into the development of composites is analysed as a set of methods designed to study the properties and structure of the material as a whole. It is noted that in the traditional approach the composite is considered as an unstructured medium, and in the case of a system approach, it is structured: in essence, a paradigm shift takes place in construction materials science.
