All the quantum algorithms are based on a certain quantum computing model, varying from the quantum circuit, one-way quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation and topological quantum computation. These four models are equivalent in computational power; among them, the quantum circuit model is most frequently used.Principles and methodologies of quantum algorithmic gates design for master course and PhD students in computer science, control engineering and intelligent robotics described.The main attention focused on the development of design method of fast quantum algorithm operators as superposition, entanglement and interference, which are in general time-consuming operations due to the number of products that have performed.As example, the method for performing Groverâ€™s interference operator without product operations introduced.Quantum computing is a vital research field in science and technology.One of the fundamental questions hardly known is how quantum computing research is developing to support scientific advances and the evolution of path-breaking technologies for economic, industrial, and social change.This study confronts the question here by applying methods of computational scientometrics for publication analyses to explain the structure and evolution of quantum computing research and technologies over a 30-year period.Results reveal that the evolution of quantum computing from 1990 to 2020 has a considerable average increase of connectivity in the network (growth of degree centrality measure), a moderate increase of the average influence of nodes on the flow between nodes (little growth of betweenness centrality measure), and a little reduction of the easiest access of each node to all other nodes (closeness centrality measure).
