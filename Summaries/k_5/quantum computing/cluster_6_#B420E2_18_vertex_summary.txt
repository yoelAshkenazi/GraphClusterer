This work is a study of the influence of the medium on the quantum system of qubits.The article assumes a description of the fundamentals of the quantum theory of information, as well as a place in it of the concept of quantum entanglement. A technique has been developed for correcting two basic types of quantum errors, based on the implementation and implementation of certain quantum schemes..
