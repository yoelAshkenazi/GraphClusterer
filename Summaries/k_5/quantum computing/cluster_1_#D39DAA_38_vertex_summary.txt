Quantum computers use processes of a quantum nature manifested with atoms, molecules, molecular clusters, etc. The description of such processes is based on the application of complex numbers and complex matrices.A general state of an $$m\otimes n$$ system is a classical-quantum state if and only if its associated $$A$$ -correlation matrix (a matrix constructed from the coherence vector of the party $$A$$, the correlation matrix of the state, and a function of the local coherence vector of the subsystem $$B$$ ), has rank no larger than $$m-1$$.
