Abstract The article presents a historical overview of the development of the mathematical idea of a quantum computing model - a new computational strategy based on the postulates of quantum mechanics and having advantages over the traditional computational model based on the Turing machine; clarified the features of the operation of multi-qubit quantum systems, which ensure the creation of efficient algorithms; the principles of quantum computing are outlined and a number of efficient quantum algorithms are described that allow solving the problem of exponential growth of the complexity of certain problems.This paper describes the basics of performance, as well as the structural and functional component of the development and implementation of the quantum computer simulator.In accordance with this, the computational structure of the quantum computer simulator has been derived, taking into account all the available features of constructing a quantum computing device.Quantum error correction is a set of methods for protecting quantum information and quantum state from unwanted interactions of the environment (decoherence) and other forms and types of noise.It provides a basis for the development of several concepts (line, node, interaction of qubits and their neighborhood) of the theoretical and practical components of low-level random quantum circuits.The results of the optimization algorithm and its comparison with the classical mathematical approach using a software model are presented..
