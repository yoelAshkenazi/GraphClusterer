Abstract This work is devoted to the comparative analysis of various scenarios of transition to introduction of the closed nuclear fuel cycle and sodium fast reactors in nuclear power of Russia.The analysis of the permissible scale of introduction of water-water power reactors and fast sodium reactors into the Russian nuclear power system was carried out taking into account the estimated reserves of natural uranium, the expected volumes of spent nuclear fuel from both national and foreign nuclear power plants and the quantity of plutonium available for the introduction of fast sodium reactors. The rate of growth in the capacity of the nuclear power system is not yet high, the resources of natural uranium seem significant, the natural uranium mining facilities and the amount of depleted uranium have not yet been classified as encumbrances. In the current situation, the practical solution to the problems of closing the nuclear fuel cycle and transition to the trajectory of development of nuclear energy as a system that meets in the future the requirements of sustainable development and energy security can already be started with the use of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel in combination with fuel from enriched regenerated uranium in existing water-water power reactors and in BN-800..
