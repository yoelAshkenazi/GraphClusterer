Abstract Nowadays, nuclear reactors became extremely fascinating not only for most of the nuclear communities but also for the prominent energy suppliers to fix the global warming effects worldwide. This paper presents a review of the last advances, applications, and challenges of nuclear reactors. Different types and classifications are introduced. Next, nuclear safety is also discussed as the most important challenging subject to develop nuclear reactors worldwide. They are specially mentioned to find the key solution for the future of nuclear energy. A brief review of nuclear roadmaps is compared with other clean green technologies as well. Estimated prospects for projects timelines and progressions of new nuclear reactors are also presented and discussed briefly. Studies confirmed that nuclear reactors are not only required for developing non-electrical applications or even high-tech systems but also they are extremely profitable to restrict global warming effects. Finally, the solution is to enhance the markets of the nuclear reactors, especially the matured Gen III+ Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) to resolve short-term problems as well as advanced futuristic developing Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) for the mid-term and long-term strategies..
