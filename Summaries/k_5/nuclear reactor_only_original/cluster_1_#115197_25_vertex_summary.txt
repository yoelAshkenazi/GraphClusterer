Can the extremely hot nuclear fuel in a nuclear power plant be cooled during an accident when regular cooling is disrupted? This is one of the most crucial safety problems in an NPP.The scientific discipline of “thermal hydraulics” is best suited to provide a solution to this query. At S&T (Science and Technology), the focus in nuclear engineering and radiation research is on multiphase flow phenomena for the safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs), particularly light water reactors (LWR).An important problem in nuclear power plants is reactor power control.In nuclear reactor, spatial oscillations in neutron flux distribution resulting from xenon reactivity feedback are a matter of concern. If the oscillations in power distribution are not controlled, power density and rate of change of power at some locations in the reactor core may exceed their respective limits causing the nuclear power plant instability. Therefore, during the design stages of any Pressurized Water Nuclear Reactor (P.W.R), it is necessary to identify the existence of xenon oscillation and to design suitable control strategy for regulating the spatial power distribution..
