A brief exposition of the principles of the use of nuclear reactions for energy generation is given.Current ways of utilising nuclear energy are introduced starting with main sources of utilising nuclear energy.The nuclear fuel cycle is introduced followed by brief characterisation of most used power reactors such as boiling water reactor, pressurised water reactor and water-water energetic reactor.This article presents an innovative nuclear power technology, based on the use of modular type fast-neutron reactors SVBR-75/100 having heavy liquid-metal coolant, i.e. eutectic lead–bismuth alloy, which was mastered in Russia for the nuclear submarines’ reactors.The chapter presents the design of nuclear reactors and their appearance, as well as the author's opinion and fundamental issues arising from these reactors.The focus is on the arrangement of the reactor core.Questions that are examined include how to organize reliable cooling of the reactor core, what main structural measures are required and applied to the physical and technical characteristics of nuclear reactors that define these measures, and so on, without going into a detailed look at the individual elements of the cooling circuit.Methods for the direct conversion of heat into electrical energy are discussed in the chapter.The main goal of the work is to identify the advantages of fast reactors when using nanotechnology in the manufacture of core materials.The research methods are based on the adaptation of known technologies (including powder metallurgy) to the design of fast reactors and on the numerical simulation of physical processes carried out using computer programs for the analysis of emergency conditions of fast reactors (including anticipated transient without scram - ATWS).
