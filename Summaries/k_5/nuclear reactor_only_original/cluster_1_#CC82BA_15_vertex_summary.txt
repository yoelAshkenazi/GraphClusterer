At the new centure's begin eight countries with developed nuclear power industry took part under the aegis of the IAEA in research of innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles to choose a nuclear power system with fast reactors based on a closed fuel cycle (CFC) and to perform joint R&D in this direction. An agreement was reached on the use of based on proven technologies CNFC-FR (Closed Nuclear Fuel Cycles and Fast Reactors), as a reference system for common assessment. Common principles, however, did not eliminate among participating countries essential discrepancies neither in existing nuclear power systems nor in development strategies, which has led to discrepancies in implementation of CFC. Gas and lead coolant are proposed along with sodium, and nitride (more dense) as well as metallic fuel – along with MOX, so the different fuel cycles. Since 2000, IV-generation reactors cooled with water at supercritical state (SCWR – Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactors) are developed in many countries. Construction of demonstration facilities are planned to 2025, followed by commercial nuclear power systems..
