Abstract Additive manufacturing, or better known as 3D printing today is one technology that is rapidly growing in several countries.This technology is increasingly having an important role not only in business and everyday products, but in the world of education.3D printer technology can be a medium of learning in the world of education in the implementation of the design in 2D and 3D design drawing students majoring in mechanical engineering.Therefore, research is needed to understand the use of new technologies in education.The purpose of this study was to analyze and gather information about the latest technology used by 3D printing.Findings from the literature review indicates the type of the latest technology used in 3D printing in manufacturing system design using computer-aided design (CAD).Overall, this review could be further research in instructional media in vocational education.In the past few decades, additive manufacturing (AM) has been developed and applied as a cost-effective and versatile technique for the fabrication of geometrically complex objects in the medical industry.In addition, medical devices used for diagnostics and treatment of various pathological conditions have been developed.The growing body of research on AM reveals its great potential in medical applications.The goal of this review is to highlight the usefulness and elucidate the current limitations of AM applications in the medical field.The propensity to manufacture functional and geometrically sophisticated parts from a wide range of metals provides the metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes superior advantages over traditional methods.The field of metal AM is currently dominated by beam-based technologies such as selective laser sintering (SLM) or electron beam melting (EBM) which have some limitations such as high production cost, residual stress and anisotropic mechanical properties induced by melting of metal powders followed by rapid solidification.
