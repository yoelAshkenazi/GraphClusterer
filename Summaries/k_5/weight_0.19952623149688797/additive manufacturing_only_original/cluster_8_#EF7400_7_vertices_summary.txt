This study proposes and discusses a methodology for the formation of a list of products for a company or a group of companies recommended to be transferred to additive manufacturing (AM). This methodology covers already manufactured products (parts and assembly units) and products being put into production. With this technique, the entire considered set of products is divided into two subsetsâ€”the first consisting of parts and assembly units, which are not economically feasible to be transferred to AM, while for the second set it is potentially beneficial. The organizational side of the proposed methodology is based on the creation of an expert group (designers, production engineers, and economists), who jointly assign identification codes to each product of the second set, which indicates whether the product can be produced by AM..
