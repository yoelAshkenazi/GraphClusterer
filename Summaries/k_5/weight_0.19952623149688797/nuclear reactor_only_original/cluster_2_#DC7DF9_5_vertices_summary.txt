The CYCLE code is intended to simulate mathematically the operation of a nuclear power system (NPS) with thermal and fast reactors in an open or closed nuclear fuel cycle, to develop scenarios of efficient nuclear power evolution in Russia and to analyze trends in global nuclear power. The code allows simulation of key facilities of the external fuel cycle (fuel fabrication and reprocessing facilities, SNF storage, uranium, plutonium, neptunium, americium and curium stores, RW long-term storage sites), nuclear reactors, including RBMK-1000 reactors, existing and advanced VVER reactors (using different fuel types), and fast reactors (both existing and innovative). As an important feature, the CYCLE code allows the evolution of the fuel's nuclide composition both in reactors and at the external fuel cycle phase to be considered in details..
