To date, several conceptual models of the organization of a two-component nuclear power system have been proposed in the world. This report presents the schematic diagrams of these models, briefly describes their main tasks and prospects for their implementation with time. As a result, based on the preliminary analysis, a model of a two-component nuclear energy system with thermal and fast reactors operating in a single closed nuclear fuel cycle is proposed. Such a model, based on existing and demonstrated technologies of thermal and fast reactors, can solve the main problems of current nuclear power, consisting in the uncontrolled accumulation of SNF volumes of thermal reactors and the inefficient use of natural uranium.This investigation is to review advanced technologies for modeling and control of reactor cores in nuclear power plants for electricity generation. A reactor core in a nuclear power plant is the key part as the hot source with radioactivity nuclear fuel, which possesses security risks and economic potential..
