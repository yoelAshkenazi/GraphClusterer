Abstract: Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has gradually been applied to the field of orthoses. This narrative review aimed to investigate the effect of 3D printed orthoses compared to conventional orthoses (non-3D printed orthoses). We searched MEDLINE for articles published up to July 27, 2020, and the main search phrases for identifying related articles were “3D printed orthosis”, “3D printed orthoses”, “3D printed braces”, “3D printing orthosis”, “3D printing braces” and “3D printing splints”..
