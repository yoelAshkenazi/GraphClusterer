The combustion efficiency and the drag force are the most important parameters on the scramjet flight performance, and finding the design point to balance the higher combustion efficiency and the lower minimum drag, which depends on the total pressure loss, can be used to optimize the supersonic combustors. The performance of the supersonic intake is considered here using some oblique shock waves with equal flow-deflection angles to compute the combustorâ€™s inlet condition. The results are presented for the constant jet to inlet pressure ratios and also for the constant equivalence ratios, in which the last one is much appropriate and utilized to find the optimum design point of the intake and the combustor, for assumed flight condition.A multi-channel gliding arc (MCGA) plasma was used to enhance ignition and combustion of ethylene fuel in a cavity-based scramjet combustor with an inflow speed of Ma = 2.92. Simultaneously electro-optical diagnostics were conducted to show characteristics of the MCGA-enhanced ignition and combustion, as well as simultaneous schlieren and CH* emission images..
