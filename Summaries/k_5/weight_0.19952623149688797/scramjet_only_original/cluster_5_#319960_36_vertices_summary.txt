The effect of the preheater combustion was analyzed by varying between a flame mode with high radical formation and a flame mode in which the concentration of the OH radicals was reduced below the detection limit of the optical system.The ignition performances of two fuel injectors were compared to estimate the influence of radicals and water molecules from the preheater on the different types of flame stabilization. The shock wave system, the hydrogen air mixing, and the flame stabilization were studied with optical methods and computational fluid dynamics. It was found out that under flight conditions chosen for the analysis the conventional design of the scramjet does not meet the limitations. That may be provided in the AJAX concept, but in this case dissipation losses increase significantly, and the propulsion system specific thrust is reduced. A modification of the AJAX concept with the combustion heat bypassing from combustor into the nozzle allows to obtain high integral parameters of the cycle with compliance within imposed engineering constraints.Thermodynamic analysis of critical regimes (regimes with thermal flow chocking phenomena at the exit) of dual-mode scramjet combustor operation has been performed using a quasi-one-dimensional flow scheme on an example of a heat supply to the gas flow in a duct with supersonic velocity at the entrance.
