Abstract Scramjet engines are considered a highly promising technology for improving high-speed flight. In this study, we investigate the effects of using multi-extruded nozzles on fuel mixing and distribution inside the combustion chamber at supersonic flow. Additionally, we explore the impact of an inner air jet on fuel mixing in annular nozzles. To model fuel penetration in the combustor, we employ a computational technique. Our findings reveal that the use of an inner air jet increases fuel mixing in the annular jet, while the use of extruded nozzles improves fuel distribution by enhancing the vortices between injectors. These results demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating multi-extruded nozzles and inner air jets in the design of scramjet engines..
