In the last few years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are making a revolution as an emerging technology with many different applications in the military, civilian, and commercial fields.The advent of autonomous drones has initiated serious challenges, including how to maintain their safe operation during their missions. The safe operation of UAVs remains an open and sensitive issue since any unexpected behavior of the drone or any hazard would lead to potential risks that might be very severe.The Internet of Drones (IoD) allows drones to collaborate safely while operating in a restricted airspace for numerous applications in Industry 4.0 world.Energy efficiency and sharing sensing data are the main challenges in swarm-drone collaboration for performing complex tasks effectively and efficiently in real-time.However, the traditional communication technologies on fixed networks or slowly moving networks cannot address the unique characteristics of drone swarm, such as high dynamic topology, intermittent links and capability constraints.Two kinds of networking techniques fit for different drone swarm tasks are investigated, and the performance indexes of several wireless technologies suitable for drone swarm are also analyzed.Considering that drone swarm would usually be deployed in dire circumstances and the network may get frequently partitioned, the robustness of drone swarm becomes crucial.Based on the Molloy-Reed criterion, a swarm intelligent robust solution for drone swarm is proposed by using the consensus method and grey prediction, which has advantages of small overhead and local information exchanging.The simulation results corroborate that the robustness to node failure of drone swarm can be effectively improved by the proposed method.The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in delivery logistics has become an efficient solution with the advancement of autonomous robotics.This paper proposes a novel mechanism that synchronizes drones and delivery trucks; particularly the case where trucks can work as mobile launching and retrieval sites.The problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Synchronized Drones.A novel Collaborative Pareto Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to compare and validate the proposed algorithm.The experimental results indicate that the proposed mechanism is an efficient solution to parcel delivery logistics.
