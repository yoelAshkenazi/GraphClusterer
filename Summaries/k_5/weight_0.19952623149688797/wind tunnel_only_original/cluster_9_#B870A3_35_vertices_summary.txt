The behavior of the high-enthalpy air flow structure along the entire duct of the T-117 hypersonic wind tunnel based at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) is studied numerically and experimentally with due allowance for the heat transfer processes in the cooler and at the wind tunnel duct walls. In numerical simulations, the hypersonic wind tunnel duct is modeled by a set of axisymmetric regions: settling chamber, contoured nozzle, schematized test section, supersonic diffuser, chamber in front of the cooler, semi-permeable region of the cooler, chamber behind the cooler, and fragment of the exhaust channel.. The use of boundary corrections has provided good correlation of the test data of airfoil NACA 6712 with the results obtained from the wind tunnel except for lift and drag coefficient values at high angles of attack.Various ways of increasing the Reynolds number, Re, in hypersonic wind tunnels were considered. Numerical and analytical investigations aimed at evaluating various methods of increasing the Re number in wind tunnels were performed with allowance for real gas effects (nitrogen or air) on stagnation pressures, p0, from 1 to 2000 MPa; stagnation temperatures, T0, from 300 to 3000 K; and Mach numbers, M, from 5 to 30. The effects of flow overexpansion in the nozzle, some cost efficiency considerations, and worldwide experience in the development of industrial gas-dynamic and aerodynamic wind tunnels were considered. From the results obtained, it is concluded that the preferable way of solving the problem of increasing the Re number in wind tunnels is to increase the stagnation pressure of the test gas for nozzle exit diameters D = 1âˆ’1.5 m and test duration up to 1 s.
