Recent increase in construction of road tunnels in cities, has increased the need for effective ventilation for removing toxic gases emitted by vehicles from the tunnels especially during traffic jams. Severe traffic jam is an inevitable part of the urban life.The objective of this study is to investigate the ventilation effectiveness of the Banana® jet fan and the traditional straight jet fan.According to the limited wind tunnel test results to obtain detailed data of surface wind pressure on buildings has important significance for the accurate calculation of cladding wind pressure and wind-induced response of structures. In this study, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) combined with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD-BPNN) is proposed for the prediction of the mean, root-mean-square (RMS) pressure coefficients and the time series of wind-induced pressures on a building surface, respectively. In this study, simultaneous pressure measurements are made on a high-rise building model in a boundary layer wind tunnel and parts of the model test data are used as the training input–output sets for BPNN and POD-BPNN models.
