Three dimensional (3D) printing is the technology to print constructs three dimensionally. Therefore, various industries including mechanics, bioengineering, and material science engineering dedicate to apply the techniques. In particular, 3D printing technique can be a fascinating method functional food manufacturing. In this study, as a preliminary study, we developed a 3D printer for food printing. First, we constructed 3D printer using conventional 3D printer kit. Then, printer nozzle and dispensing device were revised to print hydrogel, PF-127, approved by food drug administration (FDA) as ingesting food, was used. As a result, the 3D food printer well printed and made 3D constructs. In particular, 3D constructs which have unique features was able to be printed using the 3D food printer..
