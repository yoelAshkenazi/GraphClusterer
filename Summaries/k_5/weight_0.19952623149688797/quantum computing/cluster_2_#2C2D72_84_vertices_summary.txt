Quantum computers are proven to be more efficient at solving a specific class of problems compared to traditional digital computers.In quantum computing, calculations are achieved using quantum mechanics.The most well-known advantage of quantum computing is the speedup of some of the calculations, which have been performed before by classical applications.Scientists and engineers are attempting to use quantum computing in different fields of science, e.g., drug discovery, chemistry, computer science, etc.However, there are few attempts to use quantum computing in power and energy applications.This paper tries to highlight this gap by discussing one of the most famous quantum computing algorithms (i.e., Grover’s algorithm) and discussing the potential applications of this algorithm in power and energy systems, which can serve as one of the starting points for using Grover’s algorithm in power and energy systems.The use of quantum computing in graph community detection and regularity checking related to Szemeredi’s Regularity Lemma (SRL) are demonstrated with D-Wave Systems’ quantum annealer and simulations.We demonstrate the capability of quantum computing in solving hard problems relevant to big data.A new community detection algorithm based on SRL is also introduced and tested. In worst case scenario of regularity check we use Grover’s algorithm and quantum phase estimation algorithm, in order to speed-up computations using a quantum gate computers.
