As the global population grows, so will the demand for energy to ensure standards of living, health and life expectancy, literacy, opportunity, etc. To cope with this energy demand, nuclear energy, which is believed to be sustainable, clean, and safe, has been extensively advocated.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term.The article uses computational and optimization procedures and research methods.Based on the concept of a lead-cooled natural safety fast reactor for power generation, a concept of a high-power reactor with innovative core materials is proposed.Based on the existing tokamak-type fusion reactor, a concept of a hybrid fusion-fission reactor is proposed for the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste from nuclear power.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term.The article uses computational and optimization procedures and research methods.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term.The article uses computational and optimization procedures and research methods.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term.The article uses computational and optimization procedures and research methods.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term.The article uses computational and optimization procedures and research methods.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term.The article uses computational and optimization procedures and research methods.The main goal of the article is the development of the concepts of a reliable, safe, environmentally acceptable source that allows us to provide mankind with energy in the long term.
