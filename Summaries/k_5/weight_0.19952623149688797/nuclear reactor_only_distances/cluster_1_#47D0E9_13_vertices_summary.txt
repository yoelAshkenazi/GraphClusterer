Reactor power control is one of the most important problems in a nuclear power plant. Considering the importance of the neutron absorber poisons such as xenon and samarium in the design of the nuclear reactor control system and regarding the limitations of the xenon and samarium reactivity measurement, in this paper, for the first time, a modified higher-order sliding mode observer is presented to estimate the xenon and samarium reactivity in the P.W.R Nuclear Reactors..
