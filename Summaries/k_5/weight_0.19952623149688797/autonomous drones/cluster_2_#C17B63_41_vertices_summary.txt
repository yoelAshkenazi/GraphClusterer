Abstract Intensive crop production involves the widespread use of honeybees as organized pollinators. In this regard, there is a need to have a large number of bee colonies for pollination by the beginning of flowering (in May-June) of entomophilous agricultural crops in a short time. Providing a sufficient number of bees is difficult when the queen bees naturally fly around, even if they are reared in nursing families due to weather conditions (wind, low temperature, etc.). To achieve this goal, instrumental insemination of queen bees is used. The electric ejaculator is an alternating current source, the strength of which does not exceed 5 μA with the ability to regulate the output voltage from 0 to 220 V. Research carried out in the apiary of the Small Innovative Enterprise of the Kuban State Autonomous Institution “ZHIVPROM” Reduces operator time by 60%.
