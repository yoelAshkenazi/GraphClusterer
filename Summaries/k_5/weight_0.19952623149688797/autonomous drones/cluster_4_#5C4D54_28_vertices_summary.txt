Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to drastically change the structure of future cities and regions. Researchers predict different outcomes to result from the emergence of CAVs. The paper presents detailed discussions on the adoption scenarios for CAV and their possible impact on city and transport systems. A bibliometric analysis is also provided in the paper to elaborate on the evolution of disciplines related to CAVs..
