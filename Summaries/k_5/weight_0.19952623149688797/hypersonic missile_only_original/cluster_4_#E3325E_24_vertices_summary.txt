It argues that during the Iran-Iraq War, the imperative to deter Iraqi attacks on Iranian civilian centers and the need to develop a means of delivery for nuclear weapons were the primary factors that drove Iran to acquire a ballistic missile capability.In the postwar years, Iran’s ballistic missile program has been primarily driven by the need to prevent a US invasion through impeding the USA’s ability to project force into the region and threatening to target oil facilities in the Persian Gulf.These requirements have compelled Iran’s ballistic missile industries to concentrate on greater range, improved accuracy, and the development of solid-fuelled engines and more advanced warheads.To determine the nature and extent of Iranian casualties by ballistic missile attacks during the eight years of the Iraq-Iran war.The data collected about Iraqi missile strikes on Iranian cities included the following: date and time, number and type of missiles, cities targeted, and injuries and deaths resulting from impacts of missiles in civilian areas.Over a period of eight years (1980-1988), Iraqi army fired 533 ballistic missiles at Iranian territories.From those, 414 missiles (77.7%) landed on Iranian cities.The highest mortalities from ballistic missiles were in Dezful and Tehran.Our results point to the necessity of investigating the psychological consequences of Iraqi ballistic missile attacks among survivors in 27 Iranian cities during the eight years of the Iraq-Iran war..
