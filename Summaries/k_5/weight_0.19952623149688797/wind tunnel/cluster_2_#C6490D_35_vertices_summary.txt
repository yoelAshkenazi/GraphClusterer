Purpose This paper is based on the simulation of wind tunnel experiment for better understanding and predicting the behavior of PET fabric in the wind tunnel.The influences of wind angles on the behavior of a high-speed train were investigated using a scaled-down wind tunnel model (1:8 scale) at the wind angles of 0°, 5.14°, 10.2°, 15.11°, and 19.8°. Based on the experimental results elicited at different Reynolds numbers (9.44 × 105, 1.26 × 106, 1.57 × 106, and 1.89 × 106, corresponding to the wind speeds of 30 m/s, 40 m/s, 50 m/s, and 60 m/s, respectively), the speed of 60 m/s was determined as optimal for wind tunnel tests..
