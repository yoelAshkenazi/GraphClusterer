The fact that 500,000 people in the USA need bone graft each year underscores the importance of bone remodeling. Due to the limitations of autograft and allograft methods, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has become increasingly important. Since BTE scaffolds must have unique properties to adapt to the patientâ€™s body, it is crucial to choose the material and the method of making these scaffolds.Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is gaining increasing attention in medical fields, especially in dental and implant areas. Because AM technologies have many advantages in comparison with traditional technologies, such as the ability to manufacture patient-specific complex components, high material utilization, support of tissue growth, and a unique service for individual patients, AM is considered to have a large potential market in medical fields..
