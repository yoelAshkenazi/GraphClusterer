The advantage of additive manufacturing (AM) (e.g. reasonable time and expense in prototyping, and reliable product) has triggered the idea of using this method in manufacturing of marine vessels components. The current article tries to introduce basic concepts of AM method and its application in marine industry; have a glance at additive-manufactured parts microstructure; elaborate the challenges in investigation of mechanical properties of AM products; in order to makes this technology more known to domestic industry.Additive Manufacturing is a common name used for manufacturing methods that fabricate the desired part by layer-upon-layer. There is a variety of materials that can be processed by AM technologies such as polymer, metal, ceramic, biomaterial, and even concrete..
