Abstract This paper describes the application of a multilayer discrete-time cellular neural network (DT-CNN 1 ) and its hardware implementation on a field programmable gate array (FPGA 2 ) to model and simulate the nuclear reactor dynamics equations. A new computing architecture model based on FPGA and its detailed hardware implementation are proposed for accelerating the solution of nuclear reactor dynamics equations. The proposed FPGA-based reconfigurable computing platform is implemented on a Xilinx FPGA device and is utilized to simulate step and ramp perturbation transients in typical 2D nuclear reactor cores..
