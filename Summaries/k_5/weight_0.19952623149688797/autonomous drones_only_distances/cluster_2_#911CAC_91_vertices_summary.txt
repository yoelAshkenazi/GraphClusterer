A compact and low-weight LIDAR instrument has been developed for laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy sensing of maize fields.. The LIDAR instrument utilized a continuous wave diode laser (405 nm, 150 mW) for inducing fluorescence and a small spectrometer for backscattered photons acquisition.. The results of simulation reveal the proposed algorithmâ€™s remarkable cost-effectiveness and its avoidance from the risk of crossing over no-fly zone compared to the current planning methods accounting for only the shortest-path- based drone trajectory.Modern aerial robots, in particular the drones, are developing at a rapid pace. Drones appear to be a promising area in robotics performing dangerous tasks during search and rescue operations, as well as in practical applications such as photography and cinematography.An urgent task is to ensure the drone safety against their mechanical damage when interacting with the external environment, as well as the safety of people in case of contact with the drones.To solve this problem, it is advisable to use tensegrity drones with the deformable structure and the ability to adapt to the changing environment parameters taking into account the obstacles encountered in the flight.These drones are able to ensure the controlled deformation of their fuselage in flight making them more mobile in difficult environments.A method was previously proposed to plan such trajectories based on solving the optimization problem with the linear matrix inequalities..
