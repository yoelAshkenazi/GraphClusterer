This paper is devoted to research of directional regulation possibility of the properties of a composite based on the Portland cement by using limestone waste. It is shown that the introduction of limestone waste contributes to changing the nature of crystallization and structure formation of cement stone.With the introduction of limestone waste, in the amount of 15 % by weight of cement, it is possible to obtain the compositions of the class not less than B25-B35.The results of the work make it possible to recycle renewable waste of plant origin and certain mineral highly dispersed substances, and may be used in the furniture and building sectors of industry..
