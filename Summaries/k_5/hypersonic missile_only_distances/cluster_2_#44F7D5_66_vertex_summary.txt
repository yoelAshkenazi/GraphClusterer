The method takes into account the dynamic target scattering crossover. The efficiency is evaluated by conducting statistical tests on a simulation model and constructing a vertical section of the detection zone. In this case, the effective target scattering crossover of a hypersonic cruise missile is calculated depending on the parameters of its movement around the center of mass relative to the ground - based detection radar and its line of sight.This paper proposes a Hypersonic Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) for hypersonic aircraft classification based on a vehicle flight path. The experiments on synthetic data show that HCNN has a high-resolution of identification capability on three types of targets (ballistic missile, hypersonic glide vehicle, hypersonic cruise missile) even in conditions of increased measuring errors, increased time step, and with no preliminary primary data processing. Moreover, one can easily adjust the proposed network for discrimination of an enlarged number of vehicle types.In this paper, guidance law is selected as desired flight path angle that derived from the sliding mode control method..
