This paper is devoted to solving the problem of research and development of the quantum algorithms operation methods and models of quantum computer. The implemented quantum algorithm allows converting of a classical image into a quantum state, to select boundaries and convert a grayscale image into a binary one. It shows the possibilities of the quantum information theory in interpretation of classical problems.The objective of the work is computer simulation of a quantum algorithm to solve the problem of conversion a classical image using quantum computing and methods, studying existing pattern recognition algorithms and creating an effective recognition model using the features and methods of quantum computing..
