A system of unitary transformations providing two optimal copies of an arbitrary input cubit is obtained. An algorithm based on classical Boolean algebra and allowing one to find any unitary transformation realized by the quantum CNOT operators is proposed.Symmetry is a paradigm of quantum and computational chemistry (Figure 1) [...]Using a quantumlike description for light propagation in nonhomogeneous optical fibers, quantum information processing can be implemented by optical means. Quantumlike bits (qulbits) are associated to light modes in the optical fiber and quantum gates to segments of the fiber providing an unitary transformation of the mode structure along a space direction..
