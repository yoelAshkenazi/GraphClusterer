This paper shows that universal quantum computers possess decoherent histories in which complex adaptive systems evolve with high probability.Quantum computers are proven to be more efficient at solving a specific class of problems compared to traditional digital computers.The works that have been devoted to the topic of quantum computer design have been examined.The main issues surrounding the development of a quantum computer are explored.The technique can be accomplished by using nanotriggers made of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, to visualise the quantum states of qubits in advance.This paper is devoted to solving the problem of research and development of the quantum algorithms operation methods and models of quantum computer.The implemented quantum algorithm allows converting of a classical image into a quantum state, to select boundaries and convert a grayscale image into a binary one.It provides a basis for the development of several concepts (line, node, interaction of qubits and their neighborhood) of the theoretical and practical components of low-level random quantum circuits.Simulation of quantum systems that provide intrinsically fault-tolerant quantum computation is shown to preserve fault tolerance. Errors committed in the course of simulation are eliminated by the natural error-correcting features of the systems simulated.Two examples are explored, toric codes and non-abelian anyons.The latter is shown to provide universal robust quantum computation via simulation.Simulation of quantum systems that provide intrinsically fault-tolerant quantum computation is shown to preserve fault tolerance.
