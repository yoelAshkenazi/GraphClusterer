Quantum computing is rapidly shifting from high-tech lab to mainstream commercial use in the next few years, representing the next breakthrough in modern ICT. It is motivated by quantum computer's ability to perform computational tasks with efficiencies that are not possible with classical computers.. In this study, we provide a brief review on the experimental efforts towards the large-scale superconducting quantum computer, including qubit design, quantum control, readout techniques, and the implementations of error correction and quantum algorithms. Besides the state of the art, we finally discuss future perspectives, and which we hope will motivate further research.Quantum simulation of quantum chemistry is one of the most compelling applications of quantum computing. It is of particular importance in areas ranging from materials science, biochemistry, and condensed matter physics.In this article, we propose a general principle of quantum interference for quantum system, and based on this we propose a new type of computing machine, the duality computer, that may outperform in principle both classical computer and the quantum computer.
