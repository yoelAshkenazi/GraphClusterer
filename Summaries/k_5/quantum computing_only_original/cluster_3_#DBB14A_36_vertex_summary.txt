Using atoms as digital bits will start a completely new era in computer design. The author describes how such a quantum computer-a computer based on the rules of quantum mechanics-may work, and how it is going to give incredible speed and problem-solving power.We investigate the branching program complexity of quantum hashing. We require that this function is preimage-resistant and collision-resistant.We consider two complexity measures for Quantum Branching Programs (QBP): a number of qubits and a number of compu-tational steps. Moreover, we prove that such QBP construction is optimal..
