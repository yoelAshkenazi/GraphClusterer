This paper is devoted to solving the problem of research and development of the quantum algorithms operation methods and models of quantum computer. The implemented quantum algorithm allows converting of a classical image into a quantum state, to select boundaries and convert a grayscale image into a binary one. It shows the possibilities of the quantum information theory in interpretation of classical problems.The objective of the work is computer simulation of a quantum algorithm to solve the problem of conversion a classical image using quantum computing and methods, studying existing pattern recognition algorithms and creating an effective recognition model using the features and methods of quantum computing. The main difficulties in ensuring the protection of the quantum channel from various types of errors are analyzed and considered.The main obstacles to protecting the channel from noise are the inability to copy data and information, the continuity of error and the destruction of quantum information during measurement (according to the principles of quantum computing, measuring a set of qubits without destroying the information encoded there is impossible).The bit and phase types of errors were corrected by modeling quantum circuits, three-qubit coding, and a set of quantum gates.The results comparison of the classical mathematical approach for quantum computer simulation and using optimization algorithm shows that there is a significant performance improvement using quantum gates transform optimization algorithm..
