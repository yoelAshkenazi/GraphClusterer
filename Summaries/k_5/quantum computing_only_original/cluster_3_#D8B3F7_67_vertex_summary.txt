This article is about a new communication and information technology based on the principles of the quantum physics.At first we discuss about some fundamental paradigms of Quantum Computers World, and then introducing the basis of quantum computation: "QBit". After that we explain some magic properties of this atomic QBit including quantum measurement, superposition, entanglement, etc. Then we introduce quantum gates the basic modules of the next generation computers, their relation with the ordinary logical gates and the properties of some of the most useful quantum gates. And finally, we have a brief talk on some magic algorithm and the relation between these new born creatures and other fields of computers world, based on the quantum theories and manipulated by the quantum circuits.This course of lectures has been taught for several years at the Lomonosov Moscow State University; its modified version in 2021 is read in the Zhejiang University (Hangzhou), in the framework of summer school on quantum computing.The course is devoted to a new type of computations based on quantum mechanics..
