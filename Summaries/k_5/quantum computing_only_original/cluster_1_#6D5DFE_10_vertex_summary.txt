We show that the game exhibits an intriguing structure as a function of the amount of entanglement with two thresholds which separate a classical region, an intermediate region and a fully quantum region. Furthermore this quantum game is experimentally realized on our nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer.Recent advances on quantum computing hardware have pushed quantum computing to the verge of quantum supremacy. Here, we bring together many-body quantum physics and quantum computing by using a method for strongly interacting two-dimensional systems, the projected entangled-pair states, to realize an effective general-purpose simulator of quantum algorithms. The classical computing complexity of this simulator is directly related to the entanglement generation of the underlying quantum circuit rather than the number of qubits or gate operations..
