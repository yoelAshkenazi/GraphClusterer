All the quantum algorithms are based on a certain quantum computing model, varying from the quantum circuit, one-way quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation and topological quantum computation. These four models are equivalent in computational power; among them, the quantum circuit model is most frequently used. In the circuit model, it has been proved that arbitrary single-qubit rotations plus twoqubit controlled-NOT gates are universal, i.e. they can provide a set of gates to implement any quantum algorithm. This article discusses the goal for this research: it is to given a lightning-fast (as-bones-as-possible) definition of the quantum circuit model computing and leisurely development of quantum computation before actually getting around to sophisticated algorithms..
