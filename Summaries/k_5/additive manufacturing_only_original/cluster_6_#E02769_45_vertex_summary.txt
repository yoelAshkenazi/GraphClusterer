Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), is a production technique that produces three-dimensional parts. In this chapter, we focus on seven different types of AM processes, and special materials applied in major industrial applications.In this chapter, additive manufacturing (AM) technologies exploiting geopolymers (GPs) as promising green and sustainable 3D printable aluminosilicate inorganic materials. Material design and processing strategies to achieve or enhance three-dimensional printability of various geopolymer systems are summarized. The main methods of GPs based on material extrusion and powder-based printing processes are considered..
