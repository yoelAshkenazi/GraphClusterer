Abstract Additive manufacturing, i.e., 3D printing, is being increasingly utilized to fabricate a variety of complex‚Äêshaped electronics and energy devices (e.g., batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells) due to its excellent process flexibility, good geometry controllability, as well as cost and material waste reduction. In this section, the most commonly used additive manufacturing processes and heat treatments (as a post-process) for metals (titanium, aluminum, steel, etc.) and the effects (microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosive properties, thermal properties) of the heat treatment processes on the material will be discussed.. In this chapter, the AM processes that are available for metal 3D printing will be reviewed and assessed..
