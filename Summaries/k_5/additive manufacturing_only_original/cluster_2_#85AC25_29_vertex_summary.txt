Ceramic samples were fabricated from alumina using traditional and additive technologies. Slipcasting technique was used to prepare sample as a traditional way, from pink alumina ceramic slurry with further drying a high temperature treatment of dried preformed ceramics. For preparation of second sample by additive route, stereolythography or SLA 3D-printing was used.. In this chapter, the basic theoretical and experimental research studies are considered allowing to perform the closed cycle of large-sized complex-profile products manufactured using technology and equipment related to the direct laser deposition process.There are two basic additive technologies for metal powder parts growing â€“ selective laser melting and coaxial laser melting.Polymers are one of the most commonly used material categories utilized in fabricating various components in order to use in different applications. Many conventional methods have been applied for manufacturing the polymer-based structures, but additive manufacturing (AM) as a new method brought several key advantages like cost-effectiveness and the capability of fabricating complicated parts with high accuracy. However, because of naturally inferior mechanical characteristics of the parts printed with monolithic polymers, developing printable polymer composites with high performance is required.
