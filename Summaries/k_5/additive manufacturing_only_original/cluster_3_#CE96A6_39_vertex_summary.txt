History of additive manufacturing started in the 1980s in Japan. After that tens of other techniques were invented under the common name 3D printing.When stereolithography was invented rapid prototyping did not exists. Tree years later new technique was invented: selective laser sintering (SLS). First commercial SLS was in 1990.Tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine have held great promises for the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues and organs. By applying 3D printing and bioprinting, it is now possible to make tissue-engineered constructs according to desired thickness, shape, and size that resemble the native structure of lost tissues.BGs) are among the most hopeful substances regarding their excellent properties (e.g., bioactivity and biocompatibility). In addition, considering objectives and constraints of strength, fatigue lifetime, wear performance, corrosion behavior, etc., cell structures were represented as metamaterials in this chapter book, which could be obtained by the topology optimization.This study proposes and discusses a methodology for the formation of a list of products for a company or a group of companies recommended to be transferred to additive manufacturing (AM).
