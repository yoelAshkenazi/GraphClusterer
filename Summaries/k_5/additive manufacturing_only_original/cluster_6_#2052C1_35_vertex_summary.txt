Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), is a production technique that produces three-dimensional parts. In this process, materials are added gradually, layer by layer to the part.Metal and polymer have been extensively used as raw materials in AM techniques. Recently, new materials such as glass, ceramic, and composite materials have been added to this group.Additive Manufacturing is a common name used for manufacturing methods that fabricate the desired part by layer-upon-layer.There is a variety of materials that can be processed by AM technologies such as polymer, metal, ceramic, biomaterial, and even concrete.Due to their superiorities, AM technologies are classified into seven groups and four of them are well suited for metal feedstock material processing.Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) uses either a laser or an electron beam as an energy source to fuse powder particles.In Binder Jetting, a printhead deposits a binding agent to bind powder particles together, and post-processing is required to strengthen the fabricated part.Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate additive manufacturing (AM) phenomenon extending previous research results by studying in-depth the economic sustainability of AM technology and bringing out the contextual factors that drive its superior performances in comparison with conventional manufacturing, and justify its adoption in rapid prototyping (RP) from an economic point of view..
