Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing (3DP), and other technology using 3D bioprinting techniques have been used in medical applications for more than 10 years. Currently the primary use of AM in orthopedics is production of implants for total joint arthroplasties. These implants are not individually personalized but use an average bony morphology to develop sizes to fit patients in certain categories. Although the use of AM to produce a personalized arthroplasty implant is somewhat limited by materials and in some cases by a lengthy postprocessing window, the use of AM is estimated to grow at an annual rate of nearly 16% by 2020..
