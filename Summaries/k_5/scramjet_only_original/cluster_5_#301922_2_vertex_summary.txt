The supersonic combustion scramjet in the inlet applies the shock waves compression mechanism tosubstitute the actual compressor from a gas turbine engine. The scramjet works with combustion of fuel throughthe air stream in supersonic condition at least with Mach 5. Novel design of a scramjet intake system was madewith variations in the angle of the fins and entrance width. The best combination of diameter and inclinationangle was 1.75 m and 15 degrees, respectively. The findings were able to increase the oblique shock waveinteractions and supplicate effective combustion and reduce pressure losses for the effective application ofscramjet system, which can be significant for aerospace industry.This numerical study is primarily focused on the performance enhancement of scramjet intake model by introducing blunt in the leading edge of the ramp instead of a sharp leading edge..
