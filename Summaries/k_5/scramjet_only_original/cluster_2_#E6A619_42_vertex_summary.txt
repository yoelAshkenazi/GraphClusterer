In the paper a historical overview of scramjet propulsion development is presented.The conclusion about the importance of the development of three-dimensional computer models describing the process in the scramjet is made.The accurate parameter prediction of a flow field is of practical significance to promote the development of hypersonic flight.A new approach for the velocity field prediction in a scramjet isolator is developed in this study.A data-driven model is proposed for the prediction of the velocity field in a scramjet isolator by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using measurements of the pressure on the isolator.Numerical simulations of flow in a three-dimensional scramjet isolator at various Mach numbers and backpressures are carried out to establish the dataset capturing the flow mechanism over various operating conditions..
