The data-driven model successfully learns the relationship between the velocity field and pressure experienced on the wall of the isolator, i.e., the trained CNN model successfully reconstructed the velocity field based on the wall pressure on the isolator with high accuracy.Thermodynamic analysis of critical regimes (regimes with thermal flow chocking phenomena at the exit) of dual-mode scramjet combustor operation has been performed using a quasi-one-dimensional flow scheme on an example of a heat supply to the gas flow in a duct with supersonic velocity at the entrance..
