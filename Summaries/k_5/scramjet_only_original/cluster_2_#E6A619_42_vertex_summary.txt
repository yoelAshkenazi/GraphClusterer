Flow and combustion of a hydrocarbon-air mixture in a channel modeling a section of a supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) are considered. These are: H2, CH4, C2H6, kerosene. Combustion of H2-air mixture is considered with the purpose of comparisons with calculation data of H.F.Nelson (Nelson, H.F., “Radiative Heating in Scramjet combustor,” J. Thermophysics and Heat Transfer, Vol. 11, No.1, 1997) and I.Boid et al. (Crow A., Boyd I., Terrapon V., “Radiation Modeling of a Hydrogen-Fueled Scramjet,” AIAA 2011-3769. The model generalization is proposed for deceleration flows in divergent diffusers, which are found in wide applications in aerodynamic research..
