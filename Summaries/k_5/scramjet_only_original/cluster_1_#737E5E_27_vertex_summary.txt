ABSTRACT The scramjet is a rather a new technology and there are many issues related to their operation, especially when it comes to the combustion processes. Combustion in high-speed flows causes various problems such as flame instability and poor fuel–air mixing efficiency.The combustion efficiency and the drag force are the most important parameters on the scramjet flight performance, and finding the design point to balance the higher combustion efficiency and the lower minimum drag, which depends on the total pressure loss, can be used to optimize the supersonic combustors.The performance of the supersonic intake is considered here using some oblique shock waves with equal flow-deflection angles to compute the combustor’s inlet condition.The variation of combustion efficiency and total pressure loss is presented for different combustor’s inlet conditions.The results predicted are evaluated, and it was concluded that the velocity increased as the oxygen concentration was increased.The asymmetric separation has a crucial effect on the performance of the scramjet.The results of an experimental study of plasma-induced ethylene ignition and flameholding in a supersonic model combustor are presented in the paper..
