The dual-mode scramjet combustor is a promising candidate for the combined cycle engine of the hypersonic airplane, and the flame propagation and stabilization process in the dual-mode scramjet combustor has a great impact on its performance improvement. In this survey, the research progress on the flame propagation and stabilization in the dual-mode scramjet combustor is reviewed and summarized, and its main focus is on the flame stabilization mode, especially for the mode transition. The flame stabilization process in the dual-mode scramjet combustor is summarized from three aspects, namely the combustion mode classification, the mode transition and the vitiation effect.The scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) is an air-breathing engine with the supersonic flow at the combustor entrance, i.e., with essentially lower deceleration of flow in the inlet with respect to common ramjet. The scramjet is characterized by strong coupling of all its elements.Supersonic core from the inlet to the nozzle, essential subsonic zones in thick boundary layers and high losses caused by strong shock waves, by viscous effects, by dissociation and radiation result in a situation, when positive thrust may be reached only on the basis of joint optimization of the whole flowpath. In comparison with experimental investigations, which remain very challenging to conduct in such flow conditions, computational fluid dynamics is an attractive complementary tool for the study supersonic reactive flow in the scramjet flowpath..
