In this chapter, the main challenges for the invention of the scramjet engine is fully presented. The non-dimensional parameters are presented and the main advance centers for the development of the scramjet engine are introduced. Besides, the main parts of the scramjet engine is introduced and their roles on the scramjet engine is determined. In addition, required fuel types for different flight ranges are described.A step-by-step computer simulation variant for making scramjet mathematical model is offered. The report considers an approach related to 3D mathematical models development of scramjet components further reduced to 1D models.The main attention of this work is to investigate the usage of diamond multi extruded injectors on the fuel distribution in combustor of scramjet engine..
