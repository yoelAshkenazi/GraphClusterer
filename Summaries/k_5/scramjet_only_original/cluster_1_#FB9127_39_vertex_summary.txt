At present, the critical issue related to design of scramjet engine is to achieve efficient mixing between the air and fuel. Among the several fuel injection strategies, cavity flame holder is identified as a well-organized method for supporting the ignition zone.The ramjet and scramjet modes can be realized in the same flowpath using the thermal choking approach, and the dual-mode scramjet combustor has attracted an increasing attention. The ram-to-scram mode transition mechanism in a strut-based dual-mode scramjet combustor has been evaluated numerically, and the influences of the inlet boundary conditions at the entrance of the isolator, the injection strategy and the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio on the mode transition have been investigated. At the same time, the numerical approach has been validated through a turbulent diffusion combustion problem, as well as the effectiveness of the hydrogen-air chemical reaction mechanism..
