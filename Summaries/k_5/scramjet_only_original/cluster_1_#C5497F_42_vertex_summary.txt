Flow and combustion of a hydrocarbon-air mixture in a channel modeling a section of a supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) are considered. Several fuels and corresponding chemical kinetics models are considered.Combustion of H2-air mixture is considered with the purpose of comparisons with calculation data of H.F.Nelson (Nelson, H.F., “Radiative Heating in Scramjet combustor,” J. Thermophysics and Heat Transfer, Vol. 11, No.1, 1997) and I.Boid et al. (Crow A., Boyd I., Terrapon V., “Radiation Modeling of a Hydrogen-Fueled Scramjet,” AIAA 2011-3769.. Finally, guidelines for the optimization and performance improvement are provided for future research of the strut-equipped combustor.To study the thermal behavior inside scramjet cooling channels at different aspect ratios, a three-dimensional model of fuel flow in terms of the fuel real properties is built and validated through experiments. The simulation results indicate that heat transfer deterioration occurs very easily in scramjet engine cooling channels due to its small fuel mass flux, relatively high wall heat flux, and near-critical operating pressure. At last, a high operating pressure can alleviate the heat transfer deterioration, but it is not a good choice because of the heavier thermal stratification it brings and limited improvement in lowering the optimum wall temperature.
