In this chapter, the main challenges for the invention of the scramjet engine is fully presented.The primary configurations for achieving the recent scramjet engine are also reviewed. The non-dimensional parameters are presented and the main advance centers for the development of the scramjet engine are introduced. Besides, the main parts of the scramjet engine is introduced and their roles on the scramjet engine is determined. In addition, required fuel types for different flight ranges are described.Hydrogen fueled scramjet is an interesting choice to be used as engine of aerospace vehicles because of its high specific impulse. The most important challenge in scramjet engine technology is the thermal management of them. Due to high temperature of combustion, a competent cooling system which is able to recover the waste energy is needed..
