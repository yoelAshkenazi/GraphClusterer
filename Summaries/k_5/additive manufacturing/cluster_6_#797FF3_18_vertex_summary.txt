Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing (3DP), and other technology using 3D bioprinting techniques have been used in medical applications for more than 10 years. Currently the primary use of AM in orthopedics is production of implants for total joint arthroplasties. These implants are not individually personalized but use an average bony morphology to develop sizes to fit patients in certain categories. In this chapter, different AM methods and materials for making BTE scaffolds are examined.Polymers are one of the most commonly used material categories utilized in fabricating various components in order to use in different applications. Many conventional methods have been applied for manufacturing the polymer-based structures, but additive manufacturing (AM) as a new method brought several key advantages like cost-effectiveness and the capability of fabricating complicated parts with high accuracy..
