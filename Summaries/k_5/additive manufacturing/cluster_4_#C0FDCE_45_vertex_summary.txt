Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), is a production technique that produces three-dimensional parts. In this review, the recent advances in 3D printing of emerging batteries are emphasized and discussed. The recent progress in fabricating 3D‐printed batteries through the major 3D‐printing methods, including lithography‐based 3D printing, template‐assisted electrodeposition‐based 3D printing, inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and aerosol jet printing, are first summarized. Then, the significant achievements made in the development and printing of battery electrodes and electrolytes are highlighted. Finally, major challenges are discussed and potential research frontiers in developing 3D‐printed batteries are proposed..
