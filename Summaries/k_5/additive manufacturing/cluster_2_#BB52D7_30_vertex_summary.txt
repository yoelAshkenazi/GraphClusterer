Ceramic samples were fabricated from alumina using traditional and additive technologies. Slipcasting technique was used to prepare sample as a traditional way, from pink alumina ceramic slurry with further drying a high temperature treatment of dried preformed ceramics. For preparation of second sample by additive route, stereolythography or SLA 3D-printing was used.. The main current challenges, perspectives and directions of future work required to improve this technology have been delineated.In recent years, the development of additive technologies has been a priority for industry. The technology makes it possible to realize any design and engineering ideas in high-tech industries, such as shipbuilding, aircraft construction, engine and motor construction, rocket engineering, modern electronic devices, and so on with minimum expenses. However, adaption of large-size products is associated with difficulties of transfer of laboratory research results in concrete items for various industries.In this chapter, the basic research studies are considered allowing to perform the closed cycle of large-sized complex-profile products manufactured using technology and equipment related to the direct laser deposition process.There are two basic additive technologies for metal powder parts growing â€“ selective laser melting and coaxial laser melting.The fact that 500,000 people in the USA need bone graft each year underscores the importance of bone remodeling.
