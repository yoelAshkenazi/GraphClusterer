For this objective, different biomaterials were first introduced with implant applications, in the form of polymeric filaments for 3D printing. And then, various AM techniques were described for 3D-printed polymers. Finally, considering objectives and constraints of strength, fatigue lifetime, wear performance, corrosion behavior, etc., cell structures were represented as metamaterials in this chapter book, which could be obtained by the topology optimization.This study proposes and discusses a methodology for the formation of a list of products for a company or a group of companies recommended to be transferred to additive manufacturing (AM)..
