Abstract Additive manufacturing, or better known as 3D printing today is one technology that is rapidly growing in several countries. This technology is increasingly having an important role not only in business and everyday products, but in the world of education.3D printer technology can be a medium of learning in the world of education in the implementation of the design in 2D and 3D design drawing students majoring in mechanical engineering. Therefore, research is needed to understand the use of new technologies in education.The purpose of this research is to design 3D print and analyze mechanical as well as microstructural behavior of interlaced fibrous structures using Dremel 3D45 additive manufacturing (AM) machine.,A series of plain and twill weave fabrics are designed using computer-aided design software Solidworks and printed using fused deposition modeling machines to determine the best model that could be printable..
