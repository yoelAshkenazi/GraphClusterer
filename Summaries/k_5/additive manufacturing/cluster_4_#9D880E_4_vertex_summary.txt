Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is an unmanned tether-free vehicle which is powered by battery or fuel cell. The weight of the AUV is a major issue to be decided when considering its performance. To manufacture a propeller that is lighter in weight and able to carry the pressure applied to the blades is an involving process. The present study investigates the performance of the propeller of an AUV, manufactured by additive manufacturing, using ABS plastic material..
