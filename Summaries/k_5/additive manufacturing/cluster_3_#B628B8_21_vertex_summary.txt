One of the most perspective methods of additive manufacturing is selective laser melting. The profiler contributes to obtaining the alternative power density distributions of the laser beam. The CoCrMo powder was chosen because of its excellent melting qualities, and the initial powder was pre-treated with the purpose to get the diameter of the particles less than 20 Î¼m. During the experiments, 3D-samples were obtained by the improved method of selective laser melting with parameters of two process windows for each of the laser beam spot. The analysis of the obtained results confirms the incorrectness of using standard methods for determining the strength indicators of additively manufactured materials when evaluating their design characteristics; the main direction for improving printing technology is the need to improve adhesion between layers; the expediency of increasing the width and thickness of tracks, which helps to reduce the number of contact zones..
