The profiler contributes to obtaining the alternative power density distributions of the laser beam. The CoCrMo powder was chosen because of its excellent melting qualities, and the initial powder was pre-treated with the purpose to get the diameter of the particles less than 20 Î¼m. During the experiments, 3D-samples were obtained by the improved method of selective laser melting with parameters of two process windows for each of the laser beam spot. The 3D-samples were studied for the revelation of common material defects of the microstructure. The analyses showed that the samples of each laser beam spot had defects related to the formation of a solid solution. Application of Inverse Gaussian laser beam spot into the SLM-machine for production of 3D-objects allows producing the pieces with the values of the parameters exceeding the value for Gaussian laser beam spot in several times. The typically recommended parameters for production of the piece on the modern SLM-machine are less than 100 W for laser source power and less than 30 mm/s for scanning speed. The analytical data, presented in the article demonstrated the field of process parameters, which can give a possibility to obtain 3D-object with the parameters up to 1 kW for laser source power and up to 0.3 m/s for scanning speed.
