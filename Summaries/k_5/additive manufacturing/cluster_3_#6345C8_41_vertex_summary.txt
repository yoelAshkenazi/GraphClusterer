In this chapter, additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric implants will be discussed in detail. For this objective, different biomaterials were first introduced with implant applications, in the form of polymeric filaments for 3D printing. And then, various AM techniques were described for 3D-printed polymers. Finally, considering objectives and constraints of strength, fatigue lifetime, wear performance, corrosion behavior, etc., cell structures were represented as metamaterials in this chapter book, which could be obtained by the topology optimization.Additive manufacturing encompasses a group of 3D printing technologies enabling the generation of complex, biomimetic 3D structures for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine..
