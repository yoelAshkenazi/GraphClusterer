The concept of fuel supply control is introduced. Nuclear power systems with different structural organization of generating capacities and a closed nuclear fuel cycle are considered. A comparison is made of these systems in terms of their development potential, ratio between the number of thermal and fast reactors and the possibilities of fuel supply. It is noted that the ratio is determined by the breeding characteristics, the balance of plutonium and natural uranium in the system, as well as the needs for NP development. A feature of the two-component systems of nuclear reactors considered in the work, consisting of thermal reactors of different types and fast reactors BN-1200, is that the SNF stocks of all types of reactors are completely processed during the considered time interval and all the excess separated plutonium is used to manufacture MOX fuel..
