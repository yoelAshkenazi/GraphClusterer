As the global population grows, so will the demand for energy to ensure standards of living, health and life expectancy, literacy, opportunity, etc. To cope with this energy demand, nuclear energy, which is believed to be sustainable, clean, and safe, has been extensively advocated. Considering the importance of the nanofluids effect as a coolant in the nuclear reactors on the reactor dynamic parameters, in this paper, for the first time, fuel and coolant temperature reactivity coefficients which have important contribution in the dynamic analysis and safety requirements of the nuclear reactors, are calculated in a VVER-1000 Nuclear Reactor with nanofluid as a coolant..
