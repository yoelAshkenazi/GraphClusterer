All advantages of nuclear power can be fully implemented only by improving existing and developing new safe types of nuclear reactors including molten salt reactors. A promising direction is the development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle with fast reactors, which includes the production of mixed uranium-plutonium fuel, reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, and reuse (recycling) of fuel in fast-breeder reactors. The aim of this work is to examine the possibility of using molten salts as fuel in the molten salt reactors and the media for reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, as well as the presentation of the results of the systematic studies of physicochemical properties (phase diagrams, density, viscosity, surface tension) of molten ternary mixtures of uranium halides with salt diluents. Developing a database of nuclear-physical and physicochemical properties of molten salts is necessary for their optimal application in nuclear technology..
