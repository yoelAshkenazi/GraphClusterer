All advantages of nuclear power can be fully implemented only by improving existing and developing new safe types of nuclear reactors including molten salt reactors.A promising direction is the development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle with fast reactors, which includes the production of mixed uranium-plutonium fuel, reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, and reuse (recycling) of fuel in fast-breeder reactors.The aim of this work is to examine the possibility of using molten salts as fuel in the reactor core, what main structural measures are required and applied to the physical and technical characteristics of nuclear reactors that define these measures, and so on, without going into a detailed look at the individual elements of the cooling circuit.Methods for the direct conversion of heat into electrical energy are discussed in the chapter.The report presents a validated strategy of implementation of fast reactors SVBR-100 in nuclear power, which provides putting in operation the reactors using the mastered uranium oxide fuel with postponed reprocessing and changing over to the closed fuel cycle with use of the own spent fuel. By the end of the lifetime, a comparatively high core breeding ratio (~0.84) of reactor SVBR-100 using uranium oxide fuel for operation provides high content of plutonium in the spent nuclear fuel, which could be used in next fuel lifetimes while organizing the closed fuel cycle..
