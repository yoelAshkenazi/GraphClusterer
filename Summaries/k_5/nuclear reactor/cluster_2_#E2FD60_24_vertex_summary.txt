As the global population grows, so will the demand for energy to ensure standards of living, health and life expectancy, literacy, opportunity, etc. To cope with this energy demand, nuclear energy, which is believed to be sustainable, clean, and safe, has been extensively advocated. The primary purpose of the heat pipe will be to change the amount of fuel within a reactor instead of the usual purpose of transferring heat. In conjunction with heat pipes (HPs) in this chapter, we have also included a section on the Directed Reactor Auxiliary Cooling System (DRACS) and presented the scalar analysis for it, in particular in respect to advanced high temperature reactors (AHTRs) and small modular reactors (SMRs) of Generation IV (GEN-IV) such as molten salt reactor (PBR). The PBR is a design for a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled nuclear reactor. It is a type of very high temperature reactor (VHTR), one of the six classes of nuclear reactors in the Generation IV initiative..
