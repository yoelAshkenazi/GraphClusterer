The use of nano-drones to build a map is an effective method of obtaining a plan of hard-to-reach places. The paper presents algorithms for constructing a map using a graph of factors and correcting errors by recognizing a place using a Siamese convolutional neural network.The experimental results obtained with the use of a nano-drone in the autonomous flight mode are presented. The constructed map of the area was evaluated for consistency by a numerical method.The continuous monitoring by drone swarms remains a challenging problem due to the lack of power supply and the inability of drones to land on uneven surfaces. Heterogeneous swarms can support longer inspections, however, their capabilities are limited by the mobility of wheeled and legged robots in a cluttered environment.In this paper, we propose a novel concept SwarmGear for autonomous inspection..
