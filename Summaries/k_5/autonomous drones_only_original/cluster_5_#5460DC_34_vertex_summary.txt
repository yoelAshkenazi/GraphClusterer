Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today. The most important task is today the attempt to create on the basis of system of technical sight completely autonomous system of navigation for motor transport, the marine transport and aircraft. In article the problem of creation of such system for the drone which is carrying out research or rescue operations on the difficult area is considered.In the recent past, development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has entered in the arena of bio-inspired flapping-wing drones, mainly due to their ability of flying at lower speed in a silent manner.The main tool of the solution of this problem offers use of artificial neural networks of deep training or convolution networks.The quantity of layers and dimensions of local networks at their use is proved in problems of autonomous navigation of drones on the basis of systems of technical sight.In the recent decade, the rapid development of drone technologies has made many spatial problems easier to solve, including the problem of 3D reconstruction of large objects..
