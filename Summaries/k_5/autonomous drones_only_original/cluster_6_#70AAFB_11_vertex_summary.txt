In recent years, artificial intelligence has played an increasingly important role in the field of automated control of drones. After AlphaGo used Intensive Learning to defeat the World Go Championship, intensive learning gained widespread attention. However, most of the existing reinforcement learning is applied in games with only two or three moving directions. This paper proves that deep reinforcement learning can be successfully applied to an ancient puzzle game Nokia Snake after further processing.In this article, we propose a complete and robust system for the aggressive flight of autonomous quadrotors. For these applications, a human's intention is essential for deciding the topological structure of the flight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching trajectories and changing environments prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system from being applied flexibly and robustly.In this article, instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically equivalent one..
