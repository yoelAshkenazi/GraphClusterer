Advanced technological breakthroughs and exceptional levels of innovation are enhancing the capabilities and potential of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones), and in so doing attracting the interest of a broader swath of logistic companies, online retailers, and governmental agencies. These technology advancements and their impact on regulatory agencies may soon pave the way for the widespread use of drones for delivery and monitoring purposes.. In particular, we introduce our solution and its theoretical framework, and later we relax a few constraints of the baseline model (adding wind drift, and allowing the target to be randomly placed within the jammed area). Moreover, we run extensive simulations that do support our findings: even under the combined action of jamming and wind drift, the drone can reach a target randomly deployed in the jamming area-any other drone, under the same conditions, would have simply failed. As per the overhead, under very conservative assumptions, JAM-ME experiences an average overhead of 70%; however, note that such overhead can be reduced by at least a tenfold factor in practical settings-discussed in the paper. Finally, we highlight the intrinsic limitations of our solution, potential countermeasures, and new jamming strategies that can pave the way to further research.
