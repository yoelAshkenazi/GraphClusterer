The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in delivery logistics has become an efficient solution with the advancement of autonomous robotics. This paper proposes a novel mechanism that synchronizes drones and delivery trucks; particularly the case where trucks can work as mobile launching and retrieval sites. The problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Synchronized Drones. A multi-objective optimization model is developed with two conflicting objectives, minimizing the travel costs and maximizing the customer service level in terms of timely deliveries. A novel Collaborative Pareto Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to compare and validate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing solutions which employ either independent drones or truck-carried drones..
