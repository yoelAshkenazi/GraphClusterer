In this study, obtaining the rail fastener images with an autonomous drone has provided an advantage compared to the existing studies in the literature. Deep learning training was conducted with Vgg16 and ResNet101V2, which are transfer learning models, in order to determine the faults caused by the lack of fasteners. The performances of the trained models in detecting faultless and missing/faulty fasteners were compared. In the results obtained, it was seen that the training made using the ResNet101V2 model with 99&#x0025; accuracy produced results with higher accuracy.Detecting and repairing faults in railway line components is of great importance in terms of transportation safety.
