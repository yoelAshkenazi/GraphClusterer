Caries is the pathological process of hard tissue demineralization in teeth caused by various factors. As a result, necrotic areas within the tooth are formed that require removal and subsequent reconstruction in order to re-establish tooth function. This is achieved by replacing the demineralized areas with dental filling materials. With a wide variety of available dental filling materials, the dentist is faced with the task of choosing the correct material depending on the nature of the lesion. To date, the most widely used permanent filling materials are composites, which constitute one of the largest groups of filling materials. They gained their popularity due to their numerous good qualities, and the continuous research within the field of dental materials enables further improvement of their properties.The article investigates the strength of the propeller blades made of a multilayer composite material, subjected to centrifugal and gas loads with various combinations of fiberglass and carbon fiber and orientation of the material base..
