Abstract A mechanism for structuring the dispersion-filled composite materials by the example asphalt concrete is considered in this paper. The effect of an abrupt increase in the strength and water resistance of the material is conditioned the manifestation of intermolecular interaction forces, is shown, which occurs during the formation of binder films between dispersed aggregate particles with a thickness comparable to the radius of action of intermolecular attraction forces. It was established that the structuring of asphalt concrete is manifested when the thickness of the liquid interlayers between the particles of the mineral powder is about 10-7 m, which allows to attribute the effect to the category of nano effects..
