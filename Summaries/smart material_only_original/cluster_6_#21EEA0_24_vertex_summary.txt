Cellulose is the most abundant biomass material in nature, and possesses some promising properties, such as mechanical robustness, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Thus, cellulose has been widely applied in many fields.Over the last two decades, researchers, technologists, designers, and manufacturers have made enormous efforts to commercialize additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing technology in an array of fields including textile, apparel, and fashion industries. Recently, a great advancement in AM of complex architectures, which are impossible or difficult to produce otherwise, has been reported.Smart polymeric materials with dynamically tunable physico-chemical characteristics in response to changes of environmental stimuli, have received considerable attention in myriad fields. The diverse combination of their micro-/nano-structural and molecular designs creates promising and exciting opportunities for exploiting advanced smart polymeric materials..
