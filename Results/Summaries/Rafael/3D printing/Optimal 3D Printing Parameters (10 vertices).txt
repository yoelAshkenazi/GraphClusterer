A simulation model was developed to assess the printing process, which involved non-contact scanning of a 3D model and adjusting various parameters. By analyzing the printed 3D model and comparing it to its standard, the study aimed to identify the optimal printing parameters. The goal was to achieve a high degree of correspondence between the printed object and its original design, ensuring high-quality 3D printing. The result of this research provides valuable insights into the specific settings that lead to superior print quality on 3D printers.
