The NIH has introduced the NIH 3D Print Exchange, a significant initiative that addresses the need for accessible and accurate 3D models in scientific research and education. This online platform offers a solution to the scarcity of scientific models for 3D printing by providing tools that enable users to create their own 3D-printable models from various data sources. The exchange aims to democratize 3D printing technology in the scientific community, making it a valuable resource for researchers and educators. 3D printing has gained attention for its potential in creating complex electronic devices, including batteries. Recent advancements in 3D-printed batteries highlight different printing methods and their impact on electrode and electrolyte development. Challenges and future prospects of this technology suggest that with further improvements, 3D-printed batteries could offer enhanced durability, safety, and energy density, making them suitable for widespread use in various applications. The availability of platforms like the NIH 3D Print Exchange can facilitate the development and adoption of such innovative 3D printing techniques in the scientific community.
