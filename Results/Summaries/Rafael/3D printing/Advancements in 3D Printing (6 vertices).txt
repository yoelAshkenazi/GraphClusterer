3D printing technologies have made significant advancements in various fields, particularly in tissue engineering and electronics. 3D printing has proven to be a promising method for fabricating functional scaffolds that promote tissue regeneration, with several techniques such as direct 3D printing, 3D-Bioplotter printing, and fused deposition modeling being commonly used. These techniques have shown success in pre-clinical trials for regenerating different tissue types and designing implantable structures for clinical trials in various medical applications. The potential of 3D printing is further emphasized in the development of energy storage devices, including lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, where it can be used to create structural devices with improved electrochemical performances. 3D printing also extends to microfluidics, where the digital light processing variant is gaining popularity for constructing microscale 3D structures, and its success relies on controlling surface wetting characteristics. Freeform 3D printing is highlighted for its ability to create complex 3D objects with vascular networks, and the importance of material selection and rheological properties is discussed. A hybrid 3D printing process combines digital light processing and electrohydrodynamic jetting for producing transparent optoelectronic displays with various form factors, showcasing the versatility of 3D printing technologies.
