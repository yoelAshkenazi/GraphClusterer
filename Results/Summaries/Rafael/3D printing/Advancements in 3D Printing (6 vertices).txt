The field of 3D printing has seen significant advancements and applications across various domains, including tissue engineering, energy storage, and microfluidics. 3D printing technologies have been utilized to create functional scaffolds for tissue regeneration, with techniques like direct 3D printing, 3D-Bioplotter printing, and others showing success in pre-clinical settings, and these scaffolds have been used in clinical trials for bone defect restoration and various other medical applications. 3D printing is being explored for the fabrication of structural energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, offering improved electrochemical performances and flexibility for unique application scenarios. 3D printing has also been applied in microfluidics, particularly with digital light processing, to create microscale 3D structures with controlled surface wetting characteristics, aiding in the development of microfluidic devices. Freeform 3D printing has been instrumental in fabricating artificial tissues with vascularized structures, offering enhanced control over complex 3D objects with curved and irregular vascular networks, and material properties and matching between printing ink and supporting matrix are important for optimal results. A hybrid 3D printing process has been developed for producing active optoelectronic devices with various form factors, enabling the development of next-generation, freeform optoelectronics.
