3D printing technologies have showcased their versatility and impact on various fields, including tissue engineering, energy storage, and microfluidics. In tissue engineering, 3D printing is a viable method for creating functional scaffolds to promote tissue regeneration, with different printing techniques showing success in pre-clinical settings for various tissue types and clinical trials for specific applications. The technology also allows for the fabrication of precise 3D structures with high material concentrations in energy storage devices, such as structural lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. Digital light processing technology enables the construction of microscale 3D structures with controlled surface wetting characteristics, crucial for the performance of microfluidic devices. Freeform 3D printing is used for artificial tissues with vascularized structures, emphasizing the importance of material properties and matching between printing ink and supporting matrices for optimal printing quality and performance. A hybrid 3D printing process, combining digital light processing and electrohydrodynamic jetting, creates high-resolution, transparent displays embedded in 3D architectures, exemplified by a 3D-printed eyeglass-type display for wireless augmented reality.
