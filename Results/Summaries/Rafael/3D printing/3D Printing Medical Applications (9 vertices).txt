3D printing technology has various medical applications, particularly in radiology and cardiovascular medicine. Understanding 3D printing technology and its applications in radiology is crucial, covering topics like printer and software selection, model creation, and research directions. The growing use of 3D printing in healthcare, particularly for anatomical models, requires regulation and quality control. The FDA regulates software used in 3D printing, and verification and validation of 3D printed products are essential for accuracy and safety. 3D printed clothing uses traditional textile materials to improve the somatosensory experience, and a method has been developed to create 3D printed cotton-containing composite core yarns. 3D printing has clinical value in cardiopulmonary disease, providing information beyond traditional visualization tools, especially in complex anatomical structures, and has applications in heart, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases, as well as in coronavirus disease 2019 patients and cardiopulmonary bypass.
