3D printing technology is emerging in various medical fields, particularly in radiology and cardiovascular medicine. The logistic considerations for establishing a clinical 3D printing service emphasize the importance of understanding the technology and its capabilities. There is a need for regulation and quality control in 3D printing, especially in healthcare settings, with a comprehensive list of approved software platforms and 3D printers for producing anatomical models. The potential of 3D printing in improving patient care is demonstrated in studies exploring its use in surgical planning for mitral valve disease and atrial septal defect diagnosis and treatment planning. 3D printing is also applied in cardiopulmonary disease, including heart and cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and coronavirus disease 2019. The clinical value of 3D-printed personalized models lies in understanding complex anatomical structures and pathologies, especially in the cardiopulmonary system.
