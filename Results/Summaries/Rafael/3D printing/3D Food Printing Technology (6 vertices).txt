3D food printing is an innovative technology with diverse applications in the food industry, offering customization, improved nutritional content, and the ability to create complex food structures. The process involves layer-by-layer deposition of food materials, guided by digital designs. This technology has been used to create various food products like chocolates, cookies, cheese, and vegetable pastes, showcasing its versatility. The key advantages include customizability in structure, design, and nutrition, as demonstrated by the development of nutrient-dense cookies with underutilized ingredients. Printability and quality depend on product and printing parameters, as seen in the study of 3D-printed cookies. Safety is a significant concern, especially regarding food ingredients, storage stability, and labeling, as 3D-printed foods may have unique characteristics. Acceptability is another issue due to the unusual appearance of 3D-printed foods, which may require a legal framework to be classified as 'novel foods'. The future of 3D food printing looks promising, with potential for personalized nutrition and sustainable food supply chain development. Overcoming challenges related to material properties, printing conditions, and post-processing will be crucial. This includes improving the printability and mechanical properties of materials, such as hydrogel-based inks, to create customized food products. The combination of 3D food printing with cooking and the development of 4D printing are exciting prospects for the future of this technology.
