3D food printing is an innovative technology that enables the creation of customized food products with unique structures, textures, and nutritional profiles. The technology has been applied to various food materials, including naturally printable substances like cereal derivatives and chocolate, as well as alternative ingredients such as proteins and fibers from insects, algae, and food residues. This method offers the potential for personalized nutrition and can improve the sustainability of the food supply chain. However, several challenges need to be addressed, including the limited availability of printable materials that accurately mimic real food, the safety and acceptability of 3D-printed foods, and the optimization of printing conditions. Researchers are exploring the reinforcement of natural food gels and the use of hydrogel-based inks to enhance printability and create customized food products. The current state of research focuses on system design and process optimization, but more attention is needed on safety, labeling, and legal frameworks to support the widespread adoption of 3D food printing in the commercial sector.
