The versatility of 3D printing technology is showcased through its applications in various fields. 3D printing offers a low-cost, rapid prototyping method for creating functional biosensors and biomedical devices, including microfluidic, optical, electrochemical, and integrated devices, achieved through different 3D printing techniques. The technology is also applied in energy storage, specifically in the development of 3D-printed lithium-ion batteries, which exhibit impressive rate capabilities. Optimization of 3D printing parameters for specific materials, such as ABS FDM, is crucial for achieving the best tensile properties and mechanical performance of 3D-printed parts. 3D printing is used in medical applications, including fracture treatment, where patient-specific 3D-printed implants are designed and implanted based on X-ray and micro-CT images. Characterization of 3D-printed conductors employs techniques like infrared thermography and voltage contrast Scanning Electron Microscopy to understand their electrical properties. The challenge of modeling the failure behavior of 3D-printed parts due to their anisotropic properties is addressed through two proposed computational methodologies for accurate predictions.
