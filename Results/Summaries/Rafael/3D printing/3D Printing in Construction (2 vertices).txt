3D printing technology has revolutionized various industries, and its potential in construction is an exciting development. The technology is being utilized to create 3D printed concrete structures. 3D printing in construction has specific requirements and commonly used materials, and there are potential challenges and future prospects for this technology. A case study of a 3D concrete printing project for a power distribution substation demonstrated the capability of 3D printing to use ready-mixed concrete, a significant advancement in the field. The current state of 3D printing technology in construction showcases its ability to print with optimized concrete materials, but there are still limitations and challenges to overcome. By addressing these issues, the construction industry can benefit from faster, more efficient, and potentially cost-effective building processes through 3D printing technology, transforming construction methods and offering new possibilities for design and construction professionals.
