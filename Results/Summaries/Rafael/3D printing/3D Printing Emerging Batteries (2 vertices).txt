The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has recognized the potential of 3D printing technology in scientific research and education by creating the NIH 3D Print Exchange, a groundbreaking online platform that addresses the scarcity of scientific 3D models and the technical challenges associated with their creation and validation. By offering user-friendly tools, the NIH enables researchers and educators to generate and access high-quality, scientifically accurate 3D models suitable for printing. This is particularly relevant in the field of emerging batteries, where 3D printing techniques are being explored to create complex battery designs. Various 3D printing methods are being used to fabricate batteries, with progress made in creating 3D-printed battery components like electrodes and electrolytes. However, challenges and future prospects remain, suggesting that with further advancements, 3D-printed batteries could offer improved durability, safety, and energy density, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. The NIH's initiative and ongoing research in 3D printing technology demonstrate a promising future for both scientific research and the development of innovative energy devices.
