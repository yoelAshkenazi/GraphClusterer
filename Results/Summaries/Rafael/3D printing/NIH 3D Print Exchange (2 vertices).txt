The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has introduced the NIH 3D Print Exchange, a groundbreaking online platform that addresses the need for accessible and reliable 3D models in scientific research and education. This platform offers a range of tools that enable users to create 3D-printable files from various scientific data sources, including molecular structures, microscopy images, and CT scans. By doing so, the NIH aims to democratize 3D printing technology for scientific purposes, making it more accessible to researchers and educators alike. The growing importance of 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, in the field of energy storage devices, particularly batteries, is highlighted. Different 3D printing methods and their applications in creating battery components, such as electrodes and electrolytes, are reviewed. Challenges and future prospects of 3D-printed batteries are discussed, emphasizing the potential for improved safety, durability, and energy density. This technology is seen as a promising avenue for advancing the development of complex-shaped electronics and energy devices, offering benefits such as flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and material waste reduction.
