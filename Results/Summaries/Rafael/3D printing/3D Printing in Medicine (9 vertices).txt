The growing field of 3D printing technology has various medical applications, particularly in radiology and cardiovascular medicine. Understanding 3D printing technology and its capabilities is crucial, as is the need for regulation and quality control in healthcare settings. Logistic considerations for establishing a clinical 3D printing service include printer and software selection, model creation, and research directions. The current state of 3D printing in hospitals, FDA regulation, and the need for clear guidelines and standards are emphasized. 3D printing has shown clinical value in personalized models for cardiopulmonary disease, surgical planning, and mitral valve disease assessment, providing accurate and useful patient-specific models for surgical planning and intervention. The use of 3D printing in mitral valve assessment and surgical planning offers a comprehensive understanding of mitral valve anatomy and has potential applications in clinical and educational settings, requiring further investigation and validation.
