3D printing technology has made significant advancements and is finding applications across various industries, including construction. This technology offers a novel approach to building structures by utilizing 3D printed concrete materials. The development and current state of 3D printing in the construction industry highlight the potential and challenges it presents. The limitations of current 3D concrete printing include the inability to handle ready-mixed concrete with coarse aggregates. Researchers have developed a 3D concrete printer capable of printing such concrete, along with an optimized material system. A case study of a power distribution substation illustrates the equipment, software, material preparation, and construction techniques used. This comprehensive overview contributes to the knowledge and future development of 3D concrete printing in construction, offering valuable insights and practical experience. The current capabilities and challenges provide a foundation for further research and improvement in this innovative construction method.
