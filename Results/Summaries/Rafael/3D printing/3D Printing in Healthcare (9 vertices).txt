The growing field of 3D printing in healthcare has various medical applications, including radiology, cardiovascular medicine, and surgical planning. The use of 3D printing technology creates personalized models that aid in understanding complex anatomies and pathologies, particularly in cardiopulmonary and mitral valve diseases. Accurate 3D printing is crucial, with studies demonstrating the feasibility of using 3D transesophageal echocardiography images to create highly accurate models. The potential of 3D printing in mitral valve assessment shows submillimeter precision in modelling and printing. Regulation and quality control are needed to ensure safety and accuracy, with radiologists guiding the technology by providing insights into printer selection, software, and model creation. Proper documentation and reimbursement for 3D printed models in the American healthcare system are also important. The technology is a valuable tool for improving clinical outcomes, but further research and validation are needed.
