3D printing has evolved from its early days in the 1980s to become a versatile tool in various fields, including medicine, engineering, and manufacturing. The technology encompasses different methods, such as extrusion-based, inkjet, and laser-assisted printing, each with its own advantages and limitations. 3D printing has found applications in diverse industries, including creating personalized orthoses, prosthetics, and surgical implants, as well as in tissue engineering and drug manufacturing. The technology is also employed in construction, fashion design, and food production, offering unique opportunities for customization and innovation. The materials used in 3D printing are a crucial aspect, with a wide range of options available, including polymers, metals, ceramics, and composites. The properties of these materials significantly impact the quality and functionality of the printed objects. Challenges and opportunities in material selection, processing, and post-processing for various applications are significant considerations. The potential of 3D printing in education is also notable, with its ability to engage students in STEM fields and provide hands-on learning experiences, making it a valuable tool for teaching design, engineering, and technology, especially when combined with digital fabrication and computer-aided design.
