Various applications and advancements in 3D printing technology are being explored, focusing on its potential in creating functional devices and improving existing technologies. The advantages of 3D printing for biosensors and biomedical devices include different techniques and applications, despite resolution limitations, with examples such as 3D-printed microfluidic, optical, electrochemical, and integrated devices. 3D printing is also being used in energy storage, particularly for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with a specific nanocrystal material, demonstrating impressive rate capability. In medical applications, 3D printing is being used for fracture healing, involving X-ray and micro-CT imaging to create customized 3D-printed implants, although further clinical validation is needed. Optimizing 3D printing parameters for ABS FDM material can achieve the best tensile strength, using the Taguchi approach and Range Analysis. Characterization techniques for 3D-printed conductors, including a physical model and infrared thermography, can help understand their electrical properties and improve transducer design, while computational methodologies can accurately model the failure behavior of 3D-printed composite parts.
