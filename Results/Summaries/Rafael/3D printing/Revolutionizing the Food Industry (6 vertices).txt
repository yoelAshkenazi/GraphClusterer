3D food printing is an innovative technology that has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize the food industry. This technology enables the creation of 3D food structures with customized textures, shapes, and nutritional content through layer-by-layer deposition of food materials following a digital design. Main applications utilize extrusion technology with printable materials like cereal derivatives and chocolate, but there is growing interest in alternative ingredients like proteins and fibers from insects, algae, and agri-food residues. The technology offers advantages such as customizability and the ability to create complex geometries, but it also presents challenges, including ensuring the safety and edibility of 3D-printed foods and their storage stability. Proper labeling and understanding the source of ingredients are essential, especially with the globalization of 3D-printed foods. The printability of ingredients and the quality of the final product depend on various product and printing parameters. Research has focused on optimizing printing parameters and recipes, but a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between material properties, printing conditions, and the physical and sensory properties of printed foods is needed. The technology faces limitations, such as the availability of printable materials that can mimic real food properties, and the need to improve the printability and mechanical properties of hydrogel-based inks.
