3D printing technologies have shown great potential in various fields, particularly in tissue engineering and energy storage. The versatility of 3D printing allows for the creation of complex structures, including scaffolds for tissue regeneration and advanced energy storage devices. Different 3D printing techniques, such as direct 3D printing, 3D-Bioplotter printing, and fused deposition modeling, each have their own advantages and applications. For tissue engineering, 3D printing enables the fabrication of scaffolds that support tissue regeneration and have been successful in pre-clinical settings, with potential in creating implantable structures for clinical trials, addressing issues like bone defects, pulmonary diseases, and cancer. In energy storage, 3D printing is explored for creating structural energy storage devices, including lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, lithium-sulfur batteries, and lithium-oxygen batteries. The use of 3D printing in microfluidics focuses on the wetting characteristics of 3D-printed microstructures, examining the relationship between printing parameters, surface roughness, and wetting.
