Multi-axis 3D printing technology has the potential to revolutionize the creation of hydrogels, particularly when it comes to non-planar substrates. The team successfully developed a method to 3D print hydrogels based on gelatin methacryloyl using a seven-axis kinematic print head. They utilized MRI scan data of a tibia to create a smoothed bone surface, which was then used to generate non-planar layers for printing. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional triaxial printers, allowing for the printing of complex structures without the need for support structures. The printed hydrogels exhibited different properties compared to molded hydrogels, highlighting the potential of this technique. However, areas for further research include optimizing cross-linking chemistry and ink formulation, to fully unlock the capabilities of multi-axis 3D printing for hydrogel applications. This work opens up new possibilities for creating customized hydrogel structures, especially for medical applications where non-planar surfaces are involved.
