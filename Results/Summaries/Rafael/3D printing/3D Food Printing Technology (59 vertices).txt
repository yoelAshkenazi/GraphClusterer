3D food printing is an innovative technology that enables the creation of customized food products with unique structures, textures, and nutritional profiles. This technology has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize the food industry, but several challenges and considerations must be addressed for its successful implementation. Safety is a critical concern, as consumers have a right to know the source and origin of food ingredients, which can be challenging to trace in 3D-printed foods, highlighting the importance of proper labeling and the need for research on the safety and storage stability of 3D-printed foods. Customizability is a significant advantage, allowing for tailored nutritional content and personalized food products, but printability and quality are dependent on various product and printing parameters. Understanding the relationships between material properties, printing conditions, and the physical properties of printed foods is essential for optimizing the texture and taste perception of 3D-printed foods. The application of 3D food printing in the food sector is diverse, from creating complex geometries to customizing nutritional content, with main applications utilizing extrusion.
