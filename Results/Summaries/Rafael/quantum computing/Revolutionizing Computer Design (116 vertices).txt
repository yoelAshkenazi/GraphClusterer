A new era in computer design is upon us with the advent of quantum computing, which utilizes atoms as digital bits. This technology promises to revolutionize the way we use and understand computers, offering incredible speed and problem-solving capabilities. The behavior of matter on the atomic scale is governed by quantum mechanics, which differs significantly from our classical understanding of the world. While classical computers use bits built with transistors, quantum computers employ atoms, which cannot be manipulated in the same way. The concept of superposition of states and quantum entanglement is central to quantum computing, allowing for efficient problem-solving. However, not all quantum algorithms require entanglement, and attempts have been made to mimic quantum computers using classical wave superposition, albeit with exponential resource requirements. The basic unit of quantum information is the QBit, which has unique properties such as quantum measurement, superposition, and entanglement. Quantum gates, the basic modules of next-generation computers, are introduced, and their relation to ordinary logical gates is explained. The principles of quantum computing and communication are discussed, highlighting the potential of quantum computers to process data in a revolutionary way. Three leading models of quantum computers, superconducting, ion trap, and neutral-atom qubits, are compared, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Challenges associated with quantum computer development, such as hardware and market-related issues, are also addressed, including the concept of quantum correlation and its quantification.
