The development of quantum computing has made significant strides, with recent advances in hardware bringing the field closer to achieving quantum supremacy. One approach involves utilizing many-body quantum physics and a method called projected entangled-pair states to create a general-purpose simulator for quantum algorithms, where computational complexity is linked to entanglement generation rather than qubit count or gate operations. This method has been applied to study random quantum circuits, providing insights into memory and time requirements. The focus on superconducting qubits as a leading architecture for scalable quantum computers highlights the achievement of quantum supremacy with 53 superconducting qubits. Additionally, the potential of geometric phases, specifically quantum holonomies, for robust quantum computation is explored. A proposed method using transitionless driving techniques aims to speed up the implementation of adiabatic holonomic gates, offering a path towards a practical quantum computer with improved qubit coherence and computational power.
