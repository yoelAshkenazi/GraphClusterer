Quantum computing development and potential applications of quantum algorithms are explored through different quantum computing models, with the quantum circuit model being the most commonly used. The goal is to provide a concise definition of the quantum circuit model and explore quantum software engineering concepts. Design principles and methodologies of quantum algorithmic gates are emphasized, focusing on implementation on small quantum computers and potential simulation on classical computers. A new approach for circuit implementation aims to accelerate quantum massive parallel computing by optimizing operations like superposition, entanglement, and interference. Software and hardware tools support quantum algorithm simulation on small quantum computers. Quantum computing research drives scientific and technological advancements, with a transition from hardware to software research enabling faster development in quantum image processing, machine learning, and sensors. Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems, such as simulating quantum systems and large-scale linear algebra, but face challenges, with Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) being a promising approach to address these challenges.
