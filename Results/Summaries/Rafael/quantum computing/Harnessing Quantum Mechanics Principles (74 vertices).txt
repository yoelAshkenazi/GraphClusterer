Quantum computing is an emerging field that seeks to harness the principles of quantum mechanics for computational tasks, exploring theoretical foundations, hardware implementations, and potential applications. Quantum computers leverage quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform computations, offering advantages over classical computers, and come in different types, including fermionic, semiconductor-based, and unconventional quantum computers. The mathematical underpinnings of quantum computing involve complex numbers, complex matrices, and unitary topological modular functors, with fundamental components including qubits, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms. Building quantum computers poses practical challenges, such as error correction, decoherence, and noise, which can be addressed through techniques like quantum error-correcting codes and quantum interference. Quantum computing has the potential to impact fields like cryptography, chemistry, and power systems, highlighting the need for quantum-safe cryptosystems and the possibility of using quantum algorithms in various applications, including gas turbine design, railway management, and cloud-based platforms, with proposed hybrid models and new architectures to leverage its advantages while addressing its challenges.
