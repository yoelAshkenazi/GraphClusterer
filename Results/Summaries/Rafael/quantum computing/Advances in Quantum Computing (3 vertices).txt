Quantum computing has made significant strides towards achieving quantum supremacy with recent advances in hardware and the development of new methods for simulation. Utilizing projected entangled-pair states to simulate quantum algorithms determines complexity by entanglement generation rather than qubit count or gate operations, and has been applied to random quantum circuits, providing insights into memory and time requirements. The construction of large-scale quantum computers, particularly those based on superconducting qubits, has been a major focus, with the achievement of quantum supremacy with 53 superconducting qubits being a notable milestone. Geometric phases and quantum holonomies offer a robust approach to quantum computation to address noise in quantum gates. Accelerating adiabatic holonomic gates using transitionless driving techniques could pave the way for a practical quantum computer with improved coherence and computational power, as demonstrated by implementing a universal set of fast geometric quantum gates in a superconducting circuit, showcasing the potential of all-geometric approaches for quantum computing.
