Quantum computing is an emerging field that utilizes quantum mechanics principles to process information, relying on mathematical and physical foundations such as complex numbers, complex matrices, and unitary topological modular functors to describe quantum processes. Qubits, the smallest element for storing information in a quantum computer, contrast with classical bits. Various quantum computing models exist, including the quantum processor based on nanophotonic elements, the nanophotonic quantum processor with integrated quantum memory and a quantum transistor, and the quantum computer based on the Hadron Collider, as well as unconventional devices like fermionic quantum computers and computers exploiting nonlinear quantum mechanics. Quantum computing has potential advantages over classical computing, such as solving some problems more efficiently and exponential speedup in certain calculations, but also faces challenges like error correction, noise, decoherence, and creating entangled states. Quantum computing has applications in cryptography, power and energy systems, drug discovery, chemistry, computer science, gas turbine development, railway management, and contactless neuro-computer interfaces.
