Quantum computing encompasses various models, algorithms, and applications. The quantum circuit model, a widely used approach, implements any quantum algorithm through a set of universal quantum logic gates. Quantum algorithmic gates' design principles and methodologies include simulation on classical computers and circuit implementation for fast quantum parallel computing. Quantum computing has potential in image processing, machine learning, and sensors, with a noted shift from hardware to software research. Implementing quantum algorithms on current quantum devices with limited qubits and noise constraints is challenging, but Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising solution. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and error mitigation techniques are crucial for reliable quantum computing with NISQ devices. The current state and future prospects of quantum computing emphasize the need for efficient algorithms and error mitigation strategies.
