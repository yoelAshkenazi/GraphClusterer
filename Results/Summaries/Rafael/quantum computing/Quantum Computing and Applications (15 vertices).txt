Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to information processing that utilizes atoms as digital bits. The behavior of matter at the atomic scale, governed by quantum mechanics, enables a new era in computer design. Various aspects of quantum computing are explored, including the potential for exponential speedup in database searching using classical wave superposition, the construction of quantum gates and circuits, and the challenges of simulating quantum computations on classical computers. The unique properties of quantum bits (qubits) are highlighted, with a focus on their ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing of all possible states, making quantum computers exceptionally powerful. Different models of quantum computers, such as superconducting, ion trap, and neutral-atom qubits, each with its own advantages and limitations, are discussed. Quantum entanglement, a key ingredient in quantum computing, is introduced, along with the idea of using classical wave superposition to mimic quantum computers. The feasibility of building classical wave-based devices that can perform quantum algorithms with the same efficiency as quantum computers, when quantum entanglement is not required, is explored. Quantum algorithms, quantum measurement, and the challenges of designing and testing quantum algorithms due to the exponential memory and time requirements for simulations on classical computers are also touched on. Additionally, the potential of ternary quantum circuits and the realization of quantum reversible ternary half-subtractor and full-subtractor circuits are discussed.
