Missile technology encompasses various aspects, including guidance laws, control systems, aerodynamics, and propulsion, with a focus on improving performance, such as accuracy, stability, and robustness, while minimizing drag and maximizing speed. Advanced control methods, like back-stepping techniques, fuzzy estimators, and Lyapunov theorem, are used to design and analyze control systems for hypersonic missiles, achieving high accuracy, stability, and low-amplitude control inputs despite uncertainties and external disturbances. The design of missile structures, particularly for hypersonic air-breathing propulsion systems, requires creating structures that can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures while being lightweight and cost-effective. Numerical simulations and modeling techniques are used to study missile aerodynamics, including drag, shockwaves, and high-temperature air flow, optimizing designs and predicting performance in various flight conditions. Missile defense systems, infrared jamming, and the impact of missile geometry on radar cross-section are also explored, with multi-objective genetic algorithms and non-dominate sorting genetic algorithms used to optimize designs, balancing factors like drag coefficient and radar cross-section.
