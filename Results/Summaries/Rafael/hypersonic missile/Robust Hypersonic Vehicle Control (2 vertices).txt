Advanced control systems for hypersonic vehicles are being developed and applied, focusing on differentiators and fault-tolerant control (FTC) schemes. Finite- and fixed-settling time differentiators using a higher-order sliding mode (HOSM) observer offer improved performance compared to traditional methods, demonstrated through a simulation study for a hypersonic missile control system that showcases the differentiator's ability to handle external disturbances and model uncertainties while providing accurate output tracking. An FTC system for a hypersonic gliding vehicle addresses actuator faults and model uncertainties by building a control-oriented model, designing observers for fault estimation, and implementing a finite-time multivariable terminal sliding mode control, integrated using a composite-loop design to ensure the vehicle's safety after fault occurrence. Robust control strategies are crucial in handling challenges associated with hypersonic vehicle control, including external disturbances, model uncertainties, and actuator faults. Differentiators and FTC systems provide high accuracy, adaptability, and fast convergence, making them suitable for critical applications in hypersonic vehicle control.
