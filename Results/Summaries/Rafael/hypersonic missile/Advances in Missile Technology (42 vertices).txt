A wide range of topics related to missile technology, guidance, and control are covered, including a guidance law derived from sliding mode control for hypersonic missiles, with the back-stepping technique used for altitude dynamics and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy estimator for parameter uncertainty. A similar control scheme is proposed using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for parameter estimation. Fuel-cooled composite materials for hypersonic air-breathing propulsion, a crucial technology for dual-mode ramjet engines, are also discussed. Methods for calculating ballistic missile trajectories, drag reduction strategies for hypersonic vehicles, and the importance of missile and artillery air defense systems in modern warfare are also explored. CFD simulations of SCUD missile aerodynamics, missile warning systems based on passive sensor technology, and the impact of various factors on the miss distance of an anti-tank missile are also studied. Additionally, MIMO radar and anti-radiation missile engagement is modeled using game theory, and a two-step guidance strategy for multiple targets is proposed.
