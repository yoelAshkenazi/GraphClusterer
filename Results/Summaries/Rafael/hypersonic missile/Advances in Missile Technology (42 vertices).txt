Missile technology encompasses various aspects, including guidance and control systems, aerodynamics, and propulsion. Advanced control methods, such as sliding mode control, back-stepping, and fuzzy logic, improve missile performance and accuracy. Designing hypersonic missiles poses challenges due to complex dynamics, requiring advanced materials and structures. Aerodynamics plays a crucial role, with strategies for drag reduction, computational fluid dynamics simulations, and the effects of high-temperature flows on performance being key areas of focus. Minimizing drag and radar cross-section is essential, with optimization techniques proposed to achieve this. Infrared jammers impact missile guidance systems, and their use is explored. Missile defense systems involve the development of interceptor missiles and cooperative guidance strategies for multiple missiles. Missile warning systems and estimating time-to-impact pose challenges. Various factors, such as aerodynamic parameter uncertainties and guidance law assumptions, affect missile performance. Advanced control methods, materials, and simulation techniques are vital for improving missile performance and accuracy.
