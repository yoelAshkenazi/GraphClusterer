Advanced control techniques are applied to hypersonic vehicles to improve performance and handle various challenges. Finite- and fixed-settling time differentiators based on a nonrecursive higher-order sliding mode observer are used for accurate differentiation, and their performance is compared with the Levant recursive method in a hypersonic missile control scenario, showcasing their ability to handle external disturbances and model uncertainties while providing fixed convergence and settling times. A fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed for a hypersonic gliding vehicle to address actuator faults and model uncertainties, involving observers to estimate faults and uncertainties, ensuring estimation errors converge to zero in a fixed time. This is combined with a finite-time multivariable terminal sliding mode control and composite-loop design to create a fault-tolerant control system, which is tested on a six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear model, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining vehicle safety during faults. Advanced control strategies are essential for enhancing the robustness and performance of hypersonic vehicles in the presence of various uncertainties and disturbances.
