Iraqi ballistic missile attacks during the Iraq-Iran war had a significant impact on Iranian civilian populations. Over the course of the eight-year war, Iraqi forces launched a substantial number of ballistic missiles, including FROG-7, Scud, and Al-Hussein variants, targeting Iranian cities. These attacks resulted in substantial casualties, with over 2,000 deaths and more than 11,000 injuries across 27 cities, including Tehran. Tehran endured a concentrated assault over 52 days, with modified Scud missiles causing high civilian mortality rates due to their accuracy and the lack of adequate warning systems and shelters. Understanding the psychological aftermath of these attacks on survivors is crucial, and preparedness in civilian defense, rescue services, and medical facilities is necessary to mitigate potential future casualties.
