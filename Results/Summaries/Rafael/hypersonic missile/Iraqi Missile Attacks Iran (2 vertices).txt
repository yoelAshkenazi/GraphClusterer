Iraqi ballistic missile attacks during the Iraq-Iran war had a significant impact on Iranian civilian populations. Data collected over eight years shows that Iraqi forces fired a substantial number of ballistic missiles, with a large proportion targeting Iranian cities, resulting in substantial casualties. A high percentage of missiles landed in urban areas, causing the deaths of thousands of civilians and injuring many more. Tehran, the Iranian capital, was particularly affected, with modified Scud missiles causing high mortality rates due to their accuracy and the lack of adequate warning systems and shelters. The need to investigate the psychological effects on survivors in the impacted cities is emphasized, and the importance of preparedness and defense strategies to mitigate civilian casualties in such conflicts is underscored. A gender disparity in casualties was also found, with more male victims, and an average age for the affected individuals was identified.
