Iraqi missile attacks on Iran during the Iraq-Iran war had a significant impact on civilian populations. Over an eight-year period, Iraqi forces launched a substantial number of ballistic missiles, with a high percentage targeting Iranian cities, resulting in considerable civilian casualties. The types of missiles used, the cities affected, and the resulting fatalities and injuries are notable, with Tehran suffering severe casualties, particularly from modified Scud missiles that caused high mortality rates due to their accuracy and impact in densely populated areas. The psychological effects on survivors need to be investigated, and adequate warning systems, shelters, and preparedness among civilian defense forces and medical facilities are crucial to mitigate potential harm. The devastating consequences of ballistic missile attacks on civilian areas highlight the urgent need for measures to protect vulnerable populations during armed conflicts.
