Iranian casualties resulting from Iraqi ballistic missile attacks during the Iraq-Iran war reveal significant findings. Over an eight-year period, Iraqi forces launched numerous ballistic missiles, including FROG-7, Scud, and Al-Hussein variants, targeting Iranian cities, resulting in 2,312 deaths and 11,625 injuries. Tehran and Dezful experienced the highest number of fatalities from these attacks. Investigating the psychological impact on survivors across the 27 affected Iranian cities is important. Modified Scud missiles, with their high accuracy, were a primary cause of the high mortality rate in Tehran, emphasizing the need for effective warning systems and shelters to mitigate civilian losses. Civilian defense preparedness, including rescue services and medical facilities, is crucial in responding to mass casualties during such attacks.
