Two approaches to controlling hypersonic vehicles and managing disturbances are presented. The first approach focuses on differentiators, comparing a finite- and fixed-time Higher Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) differentiator with the Levant recursive method, with the HOSM differentiator offering advantages in terms of fixed convergence time estimation and improved performance in a missile control simulation. The differentiator is paired with a continuous adaptive HOSM control, featuring a double-layer adaptive algorithm, to ensure robust and accurate output tracking despite disturbances and model uncertainties. A fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for hypersonic gliding vehicles is also introduced, aiming to address actuator faults and model uncertainties, by designing specific observers to estimate actuator faults and model uncertainties, ensuring estimation errors converge to zero in a fixed settling time, and incorporating finite-time multivariable terminal sliding mode control and composite-loop design, demonstrating its effectiveness through simulations of a complex nonlinear model.
