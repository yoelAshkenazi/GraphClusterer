A range of topics related to missile defense are covered, including the development of missile defense systems, the impact of technological changes on military clashes, and the role of regional missile defense in deterrence. A method for evaluating the effectiveness of information resources in an air defense missile system when detecting a hypersonic cruise missile is introduced, considering dynamic target scattering. A Hypersonic Convolutional Neural Network is proposed for hypersonic aircraft classification, demonstrating high-resolution identification capabilities even in challenging conditions. The impact of hypersonic threats on US missile defense is examined, with a focus on doctrinal and practical changes, planned defense architecture, and the influence of China. The Biden administration's missile defense policy is analyzed, considering homeland and regional defense, advanced developments, and funding perspectives. The use of missile defense systems in conventional armed conflicts and their potential role in deterring limited nuclear strikes are discussed. The history and current state of US-Russia-NATO cooperation on missile defense are explored, including the Joint Data Exchange Center project and its potential transformation into a Multilateral Data Exchange Center. The destabilizing potential of NATO's regional missile defense enhancement is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of arms control and transparency regimes for regional stability. The development of anti-aircraft missile systems is delved into, providing detailed data on the modernization of the S-25 system and its impact on military aviation technology, and discussing the organization of import substitution processes in aircraft and missile-and-space.
