Missile technology encompasses various aspects, including guidance laws, control systems, aerodynamics, and propulsion. Guidance laws are crucial, with approaches such as the sliding mode control method, back-stepping technique, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system proposed to ensure accurate targeting, improving accuracy, stability, and control in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. Missile design focuses on reducing drag coefficients and radar cross-sections, using multi-objective genetic algorithms and non-dominate sorting genetic algorithms to optimize shapes, achieving significant reductions in drag and radar cross-section. Aerodynamics are also key, with studies investigating the effects of different shapes on aerodynamic characteristics, using computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyze flow and optimize performance. Propulsion systems are critical, with hypersonic airbreathing propulsion being a significant challenge, and the use of variable geometry dual-mode ramjet engines and innovative technologies aiming to improve performance and reduce mass and cost. The interception of ballistic missiles during their boost phase is a priority, with various weapon systems being developed, and their effectiveness analyzed considering factors such as performance and cost.
