Missile defense and related technologies are explored in various aspects, with a focus on international security, strategic stability, and technological advancements. Methods for evaluating the effectiveness of air defense missile systems against hypersonic cruise missiles are introduced, considering dynamic target scattering and using statistical tests on simulation models. A Hypersonic Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) is proposed for aircraft classification based on flight paths, demonstrating high-resolution identification capabilities even in challenging conditions. The impact of hypersonic threats on US missile defense strategies is discussed, particularly in relation to China, with an emphasis on the development of counter-hypersonic capabilities and the integration of sensors, interceptors, and advanced technologies within a unified command, control, and communication system. US missile defense policies under different administrations are examined, highlighting challenges and priorities in homeland and regional defense, as well as advanced developments. The impact of missile defense on strategic stability, arms control, and regional security is a recurring theme, with a focus on the US-Russia-NATO relationship. Various technical aspects are also covered, including the use of bistatic radar, the design of hypersonic flight vehicles, and the modernization of anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as discussions on the role of missile defense in regional deterrence and the implications of technological advancements.
