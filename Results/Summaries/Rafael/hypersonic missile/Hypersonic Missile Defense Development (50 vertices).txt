Missile defense development, technology, and strategic implications are explored through various aspects. A method for evaluating the effectiveness of information resources in detecting hypersonic cruise missiles is introduced, considering dynamic target scattering. A Hypersonic Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) is proposed for aircraft classification, demonstrating its ability to identify different targets even in challenging conditions. The impact of hypersonic threats on US missile defense is examined, emphasizing the development of sensors, interceptors, and advanced technologies, with China as a key driver and the challenges posed by boost-glide systems. US missile defense policy under the Biden administration is analyzed, considering homeland and regional defense, advanced developments, and the impact of funding and political factors. Topological scattering patterns of hypersonic missile warheads and target simulators are studied, emphasizing the role of radiation polarization. The maximum flight range of hypersonic flight vehicles with horizontal cruise flight sections is investigated, considering launch mass and payload ratios. A joint US-Russian flight test of a dual-mode scramjet aims to achieve Mach 6.5 and measure the fully supersonic combustion mode. Regional missile defense's role in deterring Russia and China is discussed, analyzing US military leaders' and experts' views, highlighting the potential for regional deterrence but also the risks of nuclear escalation. Japan's national security policy is examined, emphasizing its cautious approach.
