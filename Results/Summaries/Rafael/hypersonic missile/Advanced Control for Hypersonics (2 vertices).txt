Advanced control techniques are applied to hypersonic vehicles, focusing on differentiation and fault-tolerant control. Differentiators using a nonrecursive higher-order sliding mode observer offer fixed convergence and settling times, independent of initial conditions, and are compared to the Levant recursive method in a hypersonic missile control simulation, showcasing advantages in robustness and accuracy. A fault-tolerant control scheme for a hypersonic gliding vehicle handles actuator faults and model uncertainties by building a control-oriented model, designing observers for fault estimation, and implementing a finite-time multivariable terminal sliding mode control. This system is demonstrated through simulations on a nonlinear model, proving its effectiveness in ensuring vehicle safety. Advanced control strategies are crucial in managing the complexities of hypersonic vehicle control, particularly in addressing challenges related to differentiation and fault tolerance.
