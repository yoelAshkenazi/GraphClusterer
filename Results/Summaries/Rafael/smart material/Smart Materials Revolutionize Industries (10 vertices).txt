Smart materials, which respond to external stimuli, have shown great potential in numerous fields. In healthcare, smart biomaterials are being developed for hard tissue repair and regeneration, offering precise drug delivery, stem cell guidance, and biofilm modulation, with the potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine. Smart materials are also being explored for cardiovascular implants, creating adaptable prostheses through 4D printing. In the food industry, active and smart biodegradable packaging materials are gaining interest, enhancing food quality and safety, with sensing components providing real-time feedback on food attributes, potentially reducing food waste and improving sustainability. The application of smart materials extends to the energy sector, particularly in fusion power plants, with Self-passivating Metal Alloys with Reduced Thermo-oxidation (SMART) being developed to enhance durability and safety. Smart materials are also being integrated into wearable electronics, with MXene nanoparticles offering exceptional electrical conductivity and surface functionalities, enabling the creation of flexible and stretchy devices, providing advantages in healthcare monitoring, energy storage, and human-machine interfaces. Challenges and future prospects of these technologies emphasize the need for further research.
