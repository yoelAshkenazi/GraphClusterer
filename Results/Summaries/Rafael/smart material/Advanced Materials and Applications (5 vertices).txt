Advanced materials and their applications in various fields are being explored. The concept of 4D-printed smart materials and structures, which are complex mechanisms that can sense and respond to external stimuli without computerized control, has been introduced. 4D printing technology has potential, particularly in medical engineering, where smart medical implants, tissue engineering, and bioprinting are being developed using smart materials that respond to stimuli, enabling the creation of dynamic structures. However, challenges and future research directions remain in this field. Meanwhile, advancements in 2D materials are leading to breakthroughs in flexible electronics, with applications in batteries, micro-supercapacitors, sensors, and potential integration into soft robotics. Mechanical metamaterials are also being manufactured through 3D and 4D printing techniques, allowing the creation of complex structures and programmable mechanical metamaterials with various applications and future prospects. A novel smart electromagnetic interference is also being developed.
