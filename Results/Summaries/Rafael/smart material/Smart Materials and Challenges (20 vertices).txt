Smart materials have gained significant attention due to their ability to alter properties in response to external stimuli, offering potential advantages in various fields. These materials, including shape memory alloys, smart composites, and electro-responsive materials, are attractive for their lightweight, sensing capabilities, and design flexibility. However, challenges such as system compatibility, cost, and environmental concerns need to be addressed for widespread adoption. Research has explored the use of smart materials in construction, medical devices, and electronic applications, where they can improve building design and performance, enhance biomechanical properties, and utilize improved performance and flexibility. The development of smart materials is a global endeavor, with growing investments from businesses and governments, but raises questions about sustainability, security, and ethical considerations, requiring social discussion and sustainable development approaches, and consideration of technical, economic, and environmental criteria to ensure their effective and responsible use in different industries.
