Smart materials are substances that can alter their properties in response to external stimuli, offering advantages in terms of lightweight design, sensing capabilities, and reduced component size. These materials are being explored in construction, electronics, medicine, and sports, among other areas. Smart materials can adapt to their environment, leading to improved building performance and reduced energy consumption, and are suitable for electronic devices and wind turbines due to their self-healing properties. Smart stents can interact with the body's natural processes, providing better outcomes, and smart polymeric membrane materials are being developed for improved filtration. Smart materials can sense environmental conditions and various stimuli, enhancing athlete performance and comfort, and graphene is a promising alternative to traditional materials in touchscreen devices due to its flexibility and conductivity. The diverse applications and ongoing research in smart materials highlight their ability to revolutionize various industries by responding intelligently to external stimuli.
