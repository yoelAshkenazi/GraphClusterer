Smart materials are substances that can alter their properties in response to external stimuli, such as temperature, electrical and magnetic fields, or mechanical stress. These materials are attractive due to their lightweight, sensing capabilities, and design flexibility, making them a potential replacement for conventional technologies in fields like transportation, construction, and medicine. Specific types of smart materials include shape memory alloys, smart composites, and smart polymers, which offer unique properties such as self-healing and shape memory. Smart materials can improve building design and construction, enhance a building's useful lifespan, and reduce energy consumption, and also have potential applications in water treatment, sportswear, and touchscreen technology. However, their development and implementation must be carefully considered to ensure their long-term viability and address potential social, ethical, and regulatory concerns, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices.
