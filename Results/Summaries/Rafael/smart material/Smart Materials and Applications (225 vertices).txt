Smart materials exhibit responsiveness to various stimuli and have potential applications across diverse fields, including sensors, actuators, electronics, and healthcare. These materials, such as polymers, nanomaterials, and composites, can be prepared through chemical modifications, physical blending, and printing techniques, and designed to respond to stimuli like pH, temperature, light, and mechanical forces. Structure-property relationships, particularly in crystalline materials, are crucial, and challenges in processability and mechanical properties are being addressed. Smart materials have diverse applications, including smart drug delivery systems, wound dressings, wearable electronics, and smart textiles, offering improved performance, functionality, and adaptability in energy harvesting, health monitoring, and environmental sensing. The development of smart materials involves a multidisciplinary approach, combining materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering, with ongoing research highlighting both potential and challenges in creating advanced, responsive materials.
