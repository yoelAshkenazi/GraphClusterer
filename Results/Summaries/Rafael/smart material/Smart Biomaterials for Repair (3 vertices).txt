The field of biomaterials is evolving, particularly in the development of smart biomaterials for tissue repair and regeneration. The concept of smart biomaterials is categorized into four degrees of smartness based on their interaction with the biological environment and the responses they trigger. These materials can regulate cell behavior and provide tailored microenvironments for tissue repair, with a focus on smart drug release systems and scaffolds. Strontium-aluminate-based materials are highlighted as an important class of smart luminescent materials, offering a unique combination of properties such as low force/pressure threshold, efficient photoluminescence, and persistent afterglow. These materials have a wide range of applications, including visible strain sensing, structural health monitoring, and potential use in smart wearable devices. The mechanoluminescence phenomena, synthesis techniques, and future prospects of these materials in energy-saving lighting and displays are also of significance. Overall, smart biomaterials and mechanoluminescent materials are growing in importance, offering innovative solutions in medicine and technology.
