Smart materials, including polymers, cellulose, liquid crystals, and two-dimensional materials, are highlighted for their responsiveness to stimuli such as pH, temperature, light, and mechanical forces. These materials are being utilized in a wide range of applications, from wearable sensors and smart textiles to drug delivery systems and energy storage. Various preparation methods, including chemical modifications, physical blending, and printing techniques, are used to develop smart materials, with the significance of patterning emphasized for large-scale functional devices. The advantages of printing methods in constructing multidimensional and multimaterial architectures are also noted. Challenges and future opportunities in the development of smart materials include processability, mechanical properties, and the establishment of macroscale smart material systems. Smart materials are increasingly being integrated into textiles, providing functions such as informing, protecting, and relaxing the wearer, and are also being used in wound dressings to facilitate wound healing. Additionally, smart materials are being applied in electronic devices, particularly in the form of smart textiles, offering unique advantages over conventional planar counterparts.
