Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has made exciting advancements and evolved towards 4D printing, creating dynamic structures from smart materials that respond to external stimuli, such as heat, light, or pH, resulting in shape-shifting abilities. This technology is particularly useful in various industries, including biomedical, aerospace, and automotive, where complex structures and intelligent devices are required. The application of 4D printing in smart textiles is highlighted, where materials can transform over time, offering flexibility and functionality. Multi-material 3D printers are used to create these dynamic structures, and the technology, its processes, and materials used are focused on applications in engineering and biomedical fields. The potential of 3D and 4D printing in textile, apparel, and fashion industries is also discussed, emphasizing the creation of flexible and functional materials, with significant impact on various sectors.
