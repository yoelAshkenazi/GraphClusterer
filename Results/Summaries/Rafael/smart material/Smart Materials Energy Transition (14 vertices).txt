The concept of smart materials is a rapidly evolving field, with applications spanning across various industries and technologies. Smart materials play a crucial role in energy transition and sustainable technologies, as well as in healthcare and food packaging. In energy transition, smart materials are essential for developing advanced catalysts that operate under different conditions and for specific targets, which are necessary for renewable energy sources and delocalized productions. The challenge lies in redesigning catalysts to utilize renewable energy sources, such as photons and electrons, rather than traditional thermal processes, leading to the development of smart catalytic materials. Solid catalytic materials, controlled by external stimuli like temperature or light, can change their catalytic performances, enabling the development of AI-controlled systems that dynamically adjust their response to environmental changes. Smart materials also play a significant role in building and construction, with smart windows regulating solar radiation gain, leading to lower energy consumption, and adapting to external stimuli to optimize energy efficiency in buildings.
