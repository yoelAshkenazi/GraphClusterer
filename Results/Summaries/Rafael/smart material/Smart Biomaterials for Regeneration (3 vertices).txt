The field of smart biomaterials is evolving, particularly in hard tissue restoration and regeneration, as well as articular cartilage repair. These biomaterials are being redefined based on their interaction with the bio-environment and their ability to elicit cellular responses, categorized into four degrees of smartness: inert, active, responsive, and autonomous. Smart biomaterials have the potential to regulate cell behavior and create an optimal environment for tissue repair and regeneration, especially in challenging areas like articular cartilage, through controlled drug release, responsive scaffolds, and mimicking native tissue properties. Strontium-aluminate-based mechanoluminescent materials are a specific type of smart material with valuable applications in strain sensing, health monitoring, and energy-efficient lighting due to their unique properties. Various aspects, from synthesis techniques to potential future applications, are being explored, along with the challenges and limitations in translating these technologies from research to clinical practice.
