Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has seen significant advancements and applications across various industries, including biomedical, aerospace, and textiles. One of its fascinating aspects is the development of 4D printing, where time is introduced as the fourth dimension, enabling printed objects to transform over time when exposed to external stimuli. This technology uses smart materials, such as shape memory alloys and polymers, which respond to stimuli like heat, light, or pH, leading to shape-shifting capabilities. 4D printing has gained interest in the manufacturing of smart devices, textiles, and biomedical applications, allowing for the creation of dynamic structures, actuators, and even smart shoes and smartphones. In the biomedical field, it has potential in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and creating bioadhesive devices for targeted drug release in the GI tract. Researchers are also exploring its use in textile and fashion industries, where it can produce flexible and functional textiles with intelligent properties. 3D and 4D printing technologies offer high precision and customization, making them valuable for various sectors, with the potential for creating adaptive and responsive structures through 4D printing promising innovative solutions in multiple fields.
