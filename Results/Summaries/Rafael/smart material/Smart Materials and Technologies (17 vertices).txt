Smart materials and technologies are explored in terms of principles, applications, and development, with a focus on their cooperative system behavior and nonadditivity. The use of digital technologies in experimental studies, production, and construction is examined, highlighting the potential of BIM and digital technology in construction. Various smart materials are described, such as magnetorheological elastomers for vibration isolation, optical chromogenic filters for smart windows, and polymer-based smart materials for shape memory applications. Laser processing's potential in enhancing smart materials is also highlighted, particularly in 4D printing and photonics. Understanding activation mechanisms and polymer structures in smart materials is emphasized, especially in shape memory polymers and liquid crystalline elastomers. Smart materials for theranostic agents and an interdisciplinary module for engineering students to promote smart materials education are also discussed. The classification and systemization of smart technologies, including smart information, materials, and social-political technologies, are addressed, with a need for further research and theoretical justification in this rapidly evolving field.
