Smart materials and technologies are explored in various aspects, emphasizing their applications and potential in diverse fields. The physical-chemical principles underpinning smart materials are examined, highlighting their cooperative system behavior and similarity to biological systems. Specific smart material applications include active vibration isolation platforms using magnetorheological elastomers, smart windows with grating optical chromogenic filters for enhanced daylighting, and the integration of fiber-optic sensors in polymer composite materials for structural health monitoring. The development of smart materials in polymer science is also covered, emphasizing the advantages of smart polymers, electroactive polymers, and biopolymers. Two-dimensional smart photo-, thermo-, and electrochromic materials have potential for building and vehicle glazing, while laser processing enhances smart material properties for industries like aerospace, robotics, and healthcare. An interdisciplinary "Smart Materials" module for Master's students has been developed, focusing on internationalizing education and attracting foreign students. A classification system for smart technologies is proposed, emphasizing the need for comprehensive research and theoretical justification in this rapidly evolving field.
