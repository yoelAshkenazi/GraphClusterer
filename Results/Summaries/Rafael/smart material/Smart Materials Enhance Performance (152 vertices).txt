Smart materials, also known as stimuli-responsive materials, have the ability to react to different stimuli and adapt their properties accordingly. The development of smart alloys for fusion power plants aims to suppress oxidation and improve safety during potential accidents. Smart materials are also used in 4D printing to create programmable and adaptable prostheses, particularly for cardiovascular implants. In the food industry, smart and active biodegradable packaging materials are being developed to improve sustainability and monitor food freshness and safety. These materials can sense and respond to changes in food attributes and provide indications through sensing components. Smart electrospun fibers for textile applications can sense and interact with their environment, with potential applications in healthcare and energy storage. MXene nanoparticles have advantages in flexible electronics due to their surface functionalities, large surface area, and high electrical conductivity, making them suitable for wearable electronic technologies. Smart materials have wide-ranging applications in enhancing performance, safety, and sustainability across various industries.
