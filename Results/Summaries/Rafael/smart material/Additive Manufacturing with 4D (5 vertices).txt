Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has seen significant advancements, particularly with the introduction of 4D printing, which adds the element of time as the fourth dimension. This technology allows the creation of dynamic structures from smart materials that respond to external stimuli, such as heat, light, or pH changes, resulting in shape-shifting capabilities. The potential applications of this technology are vast, ranging from biomedical to aerospace industries, and can lead to personalized therapeutics with intelligent kinetics, as well as the production of smart devices, actuators, and smart textiles. 3D and 4D printing techniques, including screen and ink-jet printing, are being utilized to manufacture flexible, cost-effective, and functional textiles that can transform their structure or color over time when exposed to specific stimuli. Shape memory alloys and polymers are used in 4D printing, offering advantages in creating dynamic structures. Since its conceptualization in 2013, there has been growing interest in 4D printing, which has the potential to revolutionize various industries with its ability to produce complex, adaptive structures, but current challenges and the need for further exploration in this emerging field remain.
