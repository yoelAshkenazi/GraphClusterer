The field of 4D printing and smart materials is rapidly evolving, with significant advancements in various sectors. 4D-printed smart materials and structures are complex mechanisms that can sense and respond to their environment without computerized control. This technology has moved beyond science fiction and is now gaining attention in medical, artistic, and engineering fields. The potential of blending time with stimuli-responsive materials, like smart materials, is highlighted, particularly in medical engineering applications such as tissue engineering, smart implants, and drug delivery systems. 2D materials are important in the fabrication of smart flexible electronics, which has led to a paradigm shift in material chemistry and manufacturing, with developments in additive manufacturing processes, ink formulation, and applications in batteries, sensors, and soft robotics. Mechanical metamaterials have design flexibility and exceptional mechanical properties, and their combination with smart materials is leading to the development of smart programmable mechanical metamaterials. A novel smart electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material can be switched on and off, offering a new opportunity for advanced EM devices, with unique properties that allow it to be tuned for EM wave transmission or shielding, showcasing the potential of smart materials in EMI applications.
