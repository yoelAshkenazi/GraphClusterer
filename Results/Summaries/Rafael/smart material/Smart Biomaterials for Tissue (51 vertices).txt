The field of biomaterials and their applications in tissue repair and regeneration is rapidly evolving, particularly with the concept of smart biomaterials. These smart biomaterials are being redefined and categorized into four degrees of smartness based on their interaction with the biological environment and the responses they trigger. Recent advancements in smart biomaterials for hard tissue restoration emphasize their responses to stimuli and immune-modulatory properties. Articular cartilage repair is a specific area where smart biomaterials can significantly improve outcomes by regulating cell behavior and providing a conducive microenvironment for tissue regeneration through controlled drug release systems and smart scaffolds that mimic native cartilage properties. Mechanoluminescence, where mechanical force generates light energy, is an emerging area of interest in smart materials, with strontium-aluminate-based materials gaining attention for their low force threshold, efficient luminescence, and potential applications in wearable devices and energy-saving technologies. The latest research and applications of these smart materials offer a comprehensive overview of their potential in various fields, but translation from research to clinical practice remains a challenge, and further exploration is needed to fully realize the potential of smart biomaterials in tissue regeneration and other innovative applications.
