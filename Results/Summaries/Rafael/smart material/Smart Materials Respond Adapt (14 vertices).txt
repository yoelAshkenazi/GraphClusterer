Smart materials are those that can respond to external stimuli, such as temperature, light, or chemical changes, and adapt their properties accordingly. Smart materials are being developed to address the challenges of renewable energy sources and chemical production, particularly smart catalytic materials that can be controlled by artificial intelligence and operate under different conditions and targets. Smart windows can intelligently regulate solar radiation gain, leading to lower energy consumption, and smart materials can be used in facade technologies to improve energy efficiency and reduce a building's environmental impact. Smart materials can also be used in sensing and actuation applications, as well as in harvesting biomechanical energy from human motions or body heat, enabling the development of self-powered sensors and integrated transducers. Additionally, smart materials are being utilized in energy storage and conversion devices, where they can respond to changes in voltage.
