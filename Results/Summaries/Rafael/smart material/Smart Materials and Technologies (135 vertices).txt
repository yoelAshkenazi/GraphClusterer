Smart materials and technologies are discussed in terms of their principles, applications, and development, with an emphasis on their responsiveness to external stimuli and advantages such as being lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective. These materials have applications in various industries, including construction, automotive, aerospace, and healthcare, and different types of smart materials are explored, such as magnetorheological elastomers, chromogenic filters, polymer composite materials, and smart polymers. Fiber-optic sensors, laser processing, and nanoparticles are used to enhance the functionality and performance of smart materials. An educational module for Master's students in a Russian chemical engineering university focuses on smart materials, aiming to improve English proficiency and attract international students, and consists of lectures and practicums. A classification of smart technologies is proposed, including smart information technologies, smart materials technologies, and smart social-political technologies, with a need for theoretical justification and comprehensive research in this field.
