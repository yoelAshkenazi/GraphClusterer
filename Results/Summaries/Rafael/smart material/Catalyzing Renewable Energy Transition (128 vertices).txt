The energy transition, driven by economic and geopolitical motivations, is transforming the production system, particularly in the energy and chemistry sectors. This transition is catalyzed by the nexus between energy and chemistry, and it presents a significant challenge in redesigning catalysts for renewable energy sources in delocalized productions. Smart catalytic materials are introduced, where catalysts can be controlled by external stimuli, such as temperature, light, or pH, to adapt their properties and performance. These materials can be classified into two main types: those with self-regenerative functionalities and those based on the concept of soft matter in catalysis. Various types of smart materials, including polybenzoxazines, smart windows, conductive polymers, smart composites, and smart energy devices, offer advanced properties and functionalities, such as self-healing, electrochromism, shape memory, photodetection, and thermal responsivity. Smart materials are also explored in the context of food packaging, healthcare, and water treatment, with nanotechnology and smart membranes highlighted for their potential in creating responsive and adaptive packaging systems and improving the efficiency and sustainability of water treatment processes. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms and practical implementation of smart materials and devices is crucial, with challenges and potential solutions discussed in materials synthesis, device fabrication, and performance optimization. The potential of smart materials and devices is highlighted in various applications.
