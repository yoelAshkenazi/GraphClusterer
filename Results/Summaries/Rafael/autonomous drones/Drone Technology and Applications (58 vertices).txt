Drone technology has various applications and advancements that improve efficiency, security, and data management in different scenarios. The concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) highlights the importance of secure consensus achievement and energy efficiency in drone swarms for complex tasks, with a proposed blockchain-based approach to enhance security and connectivity during multi-drone operations. A drone-assisted radio access network architecture utilizes drones as relay points between base stations and users, employing a drone-cell deployment algorithm to maximize user coverage while maintaining link quality. Data security in drone-based IoT applications is addressed through a distributed solution using blockchain to ensure data integrity and secure communication between drones and the control system. Drones also have practical applications in cleaning photovoltaic (PV) panels, demonstrating that drone thrust can effectively remove dust and improve panel efficiency, especially in dusty environments like Saudi Arabia, showcasing the diverse applications of drones, emphasizing security, efficiency, and problem-solving in various industries.
