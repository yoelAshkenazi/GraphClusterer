Open-source technology has various applications in unmanned vehicles, including drones and underwater vehicles. Open-Source Tools (OST) and Open-Source Software (OSS) offer benefits such as improved accessibility, customization, and cost-effectiveness in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Specific OSS tools are used in UAVs for flight planning, data processing, and photogrammetry. A low-cost, open-source, 3D-printed thruster design using off-the-shelf drone motors has been developed for autonomous vehicles. A portable drone design for educational purposes utilizes a Y6 frame module and easily accessible components, emphasizing affordability and combinability. Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems (TSDS) are applied in autonomous drones, with a proposed formalism using Multiset Rewriting language to specify and analyze TSDS, considering time constraints and environmental factors.
