Open-source technology has various applications in unmanned vehicles, specifically drones and underwater vehicles. The growing popularity of Open-Source Tools (OST) in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) community has several benefits, including the use of open-source software and hardware for UAV-related tasks. Different open-source software tools, such as autopilot firmware, ground station software, and data processing suites, are used in UAV technology. An open-source, 3D-printed thruster design for autonomous underwater vehicles addresses the high cost of traditional thrusters, offering a practical approach to designing and testing thrusters using open-source software tools. A portable drone for educational purposes has been developed, considering affordability and component availability, featuring a foldable structure, water protection, and propeller optimization for maximum thrust. Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems (TSDS) in the context of autonomous drones require meeting time constraints in dynamic environments, and a Multiset Rewriting language with explicit time has been proposed to address these challenges. Overall, open-source solutions have a significant impact in the field of unmanned vehicles, covering both hardware and software innovations.
