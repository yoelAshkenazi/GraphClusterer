The safe operation of railways heavily relies on the proper functioning of rail fasteners, and any faults in these components can have severe consequences. An innovative approach to fault detection employs deep learning techniques on a unique dataset of railway images captured by an autonomous drone, with the main focus being to identify missing or faulty fasteners, which is crucial for maintaining rail infrastructure. Two different deep learning models, Vgg16 and ResNet101V2, were utilized for training, with the latter demonstrating superior performance, achieving an impressive 99% accuracy in detecting faulty fasteners. Furthermore, the Mask R-CNN architecture was employed to segment and label healthy and missing fasteners in the drone-captured images, resulting in a highly accurate detection method, with the evaluation of this model showing a precision of 98% and a recall of 96%, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying fastener issues, showcasing the potential of combining autonomous data collection with deep learning for railway maintenance and safety.
