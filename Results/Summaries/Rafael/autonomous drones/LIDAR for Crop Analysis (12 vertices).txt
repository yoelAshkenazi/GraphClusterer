Researchers have created a lightweight fluorescence LIDAR system, integrating a diode laser and a mini-spectrometer, which can be mounted on a quadrocopter for aerial vegetation analysis. This innovative technology enables the remote sensing of fluorescence spectra from a distance of 8 meters, making it suitable for various applications in agriculture. By conducting field tests on a maize field, the team demonstrated the LIDAR's capability to identify healthy and diseased plants during different growth stages. This early detection of crop diseases through autonomous LIDAR monitoring has the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices, ensuring timely interventions and improved crop management.
