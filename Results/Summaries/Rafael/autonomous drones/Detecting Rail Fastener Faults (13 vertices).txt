Detecting and addressing faults in railroad track fasteners is a critical task essential for ensuring safe rail travel. A novel approach utilizes deep learning techniques on a unique dataset of railway images captured by an autonomous drone, enabling the autonomous collection of rail fastener images. The deep learning models Vgg16 and ResNet101V2 were employed for training, aiming to identify faults related to missing fasteners. The results demonstrate the superiority of the ResNet101V2 model, achieving an impressive 99% accuracy in detecting faulty and faultless fasteners. The Mask R-CNN architecture was utilized to segment and label healthy and missing fasteners in the drone-captured images, achieving high precision (98%) and recall (96%) values, confirming the effectiveness of this approach in accurately identifying and distinguishing between healthy and missing fasteners. This contributes to the advancement of railway safety by providing an efficient and reliable method for fastener fault detection.
