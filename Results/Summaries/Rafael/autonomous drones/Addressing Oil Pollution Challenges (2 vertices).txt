Growing issue of oil pollution in specific marine areas can be addressed with an innovative monitoring system that utilizes drones equipped with optical sensing and artificial intelligence to detect and classify thin oil slicks on the sea surface. The system also includes a framework for identifying and measuring the concentration of oil products in solution using laser-induced fluorescence and has been successfully tested for marine fuel slick pollution detection. Oil pollution is not the only challenge, as artificial intelligence technologies also pose legal and criminal implications, such as phishing, drone misuse, and fake information synthesis, raising the question of criminal liability when AI technologies act autonomously without direct human control. Determining liability requires a re-examination of the legal concept of "innocent harm" and the development of new legal norms that can adapt to the unique challenges posed by AI technologies, moving from traditional legal texts to a more dynamic "law as a code" approach.
