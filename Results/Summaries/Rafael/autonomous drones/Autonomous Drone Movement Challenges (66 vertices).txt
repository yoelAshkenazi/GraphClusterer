The utilization of drones for various tasks, such as monitoring, surveillance, and delivery, has become increasingly prevalent due to advancements in technology. However, the development of fully autonomous drones for these tasks presents numerous challenges, including safe movement, collision avoidance, and the ability to operate in unknown environments. One significant challenge is the need for drones to have the capability to move autonomously, which is crucial for their safe operation, especially in complex and unpredictable environments. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning and potential field methods, has been proposed to address this challenge. These methods enable drones to learn and adapt to their surroundings, allowing them to navigate through obstacles and find optimal paths. Another critical aspect of autonomous drone movement is the ability to operate safely in unknown environments. Most current systems rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) for localization, which may not be suitable in certain situations due to accuracy limitations. To overcome this issue, researchers have proposed alternative localization methods, such as monocular SLAM and inertial measurement units (IMU), which can provide more accurate and reliable positioning information. The need for drones to operate in a coordinated manner, especially in swarm scenarios, presents another challenge. Swarm robotics has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue, enabling drones to collaborate and share information efficiently. However, ensuring the robustness and stability of drone swarms remains a complex task, requiring advanced control algorithms and communication techniques.
