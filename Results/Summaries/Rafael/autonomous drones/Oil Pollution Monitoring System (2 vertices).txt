Oil pollution in marine environments is a growing issue, particularly in localized areas, and a novel solution for monitoring and detecting oil slicks on the sea surface has been introduced. A monitoring system comprised of three separate Hard and Soft Frameworks utilizes drones, optical sensing, and artificial intelligence to detect and classify thin oil slicks, identify oil products and measure their concentration, and ensure autonomous navigation and drone control. This system allows for efficient and cost-effective monitoring, especially in cases of minor oil spills. Meanwhile, crimes involving artificial intelligence technologies pose legal and policy implications, with challenges in determining criminal liability when AI systems act autonomously. To address this, a re-examination of the legal concept of "innocent harm" and the development of new legal norms that adapt to AI technologies are proposed, moving from "law as a text" to "law as a code" implemented through technological platforms.
