Autonomous drones have vast potential and various applications, with artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural networks enabling them to navigate and perform tasks independently. Drones are utilized for surveillance, mapping, and inspection, particularly in challenging environments like forests, urban areas, and disaster zones. Technical aspects of drone development include monocular vision, SLAM, and inertial measurement units for autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance, with a need for efficient power supply and energy management. Solutions such as solar-powered charging systems and hybrid power architectures are proposed, and collision avoidance and swarm coordination are discussed with various algorithms and methods presented. Drones have applications in logistics and transportation, including delivery and monitoring, with potential benefits in reducing congestion and CO2 emissions, but challenges related to flight logistics, collision avoidance, and limited battery life remain. The integration of drones into existing infrastructure and the development of robust anti-drone systems are also explored, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state and future potential of autonomous drones.
