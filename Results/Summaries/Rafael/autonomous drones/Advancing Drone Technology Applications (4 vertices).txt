Drone technology is being applied and advanced in various ways to improve efficiency, security, and collaboration in different scenarios. The concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) has been introduced to enhance drone collaboration in restricted airspaces, addressing challenges related to energy efficiency and data sharing, with a proposed blockchain-based approach to secure multi-drone collaboration. Drones are also being used as relay points between base stations and users to improve coverage and connectivity, with a deployment algorithm, DI-PSO, to optimize drone placements and maximize user coverage while maintaining link quality. A blockchain-based solution has been proposed to ensure data integrity and secure communication between drones and the control system in drone-based IoT applications. Additionally, drones have been shown to be effective in cleaning photovoltaic (PV) panels, using downward thrust to remove dust and improve panel efficiency. Overall, these applications highlight the diverse uses of drones, emphasizing improvements in collaboration, connectivity, and data security through innovative technologies like blockchain and optimized deployment algorithms, while also showcasing their practical utility in maintaining and enhancing existing systems.
