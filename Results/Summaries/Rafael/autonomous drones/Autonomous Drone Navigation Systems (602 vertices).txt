Autonomous drones and drone swarms are a rapidly growing field with numerous applications across various sectors, including logistics, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue operations. Navigation is a critical aspect of autonomous drone operation, with proposed methods including artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms to recognize and avoid obstacles, and hybrid algorithms combining potential field and curl-free vector field methods to prevent getting stuck in local minima. Collision avoidance is also crucial, especially in swarm scenarios, with proposed methods including potential field methods and modified curl-free vector field-based algorithms to prevent intra-swarm collisions. Power supply is a significant challenge, with proposed solutions including solar-powered charging systems, battery-powered drones, and hybrid power supply systems combining multiple power sources, such as fuel cells, batteries, solar cells.
