Drone technology is being applied and advanced across multiple fields. In agriculture, drones are used for remote sensing, monitoring and optimizing production processes, and precision spraying, seen as a necessary step towards modern, sustainable farming, with benefits including increased crop production and quality, and improved environmental well-being. However, challenges and prerequisites to their implementation exist, including policy, knowledge, and technology-related issues. Drones are efficient and environmentally friendly for emergency medical services, with the potential to save lives and reduce carbon emissions. The energy efficiency of drones can be improved in swarming formations, with specific replacement mechanisms and formations extending flight times and distances. Drones can also carry out laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy sensing of maize fields, detecting and locating plants under stress. The broader impact of connected and autonomous vehicles, including drones, on future cities and transport systems emphasizes the need for a comprehensive understanding of their adoption scenarios and potential outcomes.
