Autonomous technology has various aspects and applications, with a particular focus on the Internet of Autonomous Things (IoAT) and its potential across different sectors. IoAT has diverse applications in transportation, military, aerospace, healthcare, and home robotics, with deep learning and AI being fundamental to these advancements. The development of a specific IoT antenna for drone-based applications demonstrates the practical implementation of IoAT in drone technology. Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) pose challenges and opportunities, and reinforcement learning-based routing protocols can enhance communication between drones, creating adaptive and efficient routing protocols in these dynamic networks. The breadth of IoAT applications and the technical challenges and innovations that come with it, including the development of specialized hardware and the application of machine learning techniques, emphasize the growing importance of autonomous technologies and the ongoing research efforts to address their unique requirements.
