JAM-ME is an innovative autonomous navigation system designed for drones, enabling them to overcome anti-drone jamming protection. It is a significant advancement over current solutions, as it allows drones to successfully reach their targets even in the presence of jamming and wind drift. The concept is introduced and a theoretical framework is provided, followed by simulations that demonstrate its effectiveness. Despite an average overhead of 70% in the simulations, it is argued that this can be significantly reduced in practical scenarios. Limitations of JAM-ME are acknowledged, suggesting potential countermeasures and future research directions to enhance the system's capabilities and address any vulnerabilities. The proposed system has the potential to revolutionize drone navigation in hostile environments, but further exploration is needed to fully understand and optimize its performance.
