The growing issue of oil pollution in seas necessitates an efficient monitoring system, and a project utilizing drones, optical sensing, and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect oil slicks on the sea surface has been developed. This monitoring system is divided into three Hard and Soft Frameworks (HSFWs), each with a specific function: HSFW1 uses AI for autonomous detection and classification of thin oil slicks, HSFW2 employs Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) to identify and measure the concentration of oil products, and HSFW3 is responsible for drone navigation and control. The system has been tested and proven effective in detecting marine fuel pollution. Meanwhile, AI technologies also raise legal and criminal policy implications, with challenges including determining criminal liability when AI technologies act independently without human intervention. Various crimes associated with AI, such as phishing, drone misuse, and fake information synthesis, necessitate a new direction for criminal policy, potentially shifting from traditional legal texts to a "law as a code" approach. Ultimately, AI technology presents both opportunities for environmental protection and monitoring, as well as complex legal challenges in the context of criminal activities, highlighting the need for innovative solutions.
