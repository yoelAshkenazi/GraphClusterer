The safety of railway transportation heavily relies on the detection and repair of faulty components, particularly rail fasteners. A novel approach to identify such faults utilizes deep learning techniques on a dataset of railway images captured by an autonomous drone. Two different deep learning models, Vgg16 and ResNet101V2, were employed for training, with the latter demonstrating superior performance in detecting missing or faulty fasteners, achieving an impressive 99% accuracy. Furthermore, the Mask R-CNN architecture was utilized to label and train the model on healthy and missing fasteners, resulting in highly accurate detection with a precision of 98% and a recall of 96%. This research highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in fault detection and the significant role of data quality, as the use of autonomous drone imagery provided an advantage over traditional methods.
