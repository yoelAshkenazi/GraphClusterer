The utilization of specific materials can enhance the performance of energy storage devices, particularly supercapacitors. Biomass-derived carbons and their composites with conductive materials, such as metals, metal sulfides, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide, can reduce internal resistance, leading to improved charge/discharge capabilities and higher specific capacitance values. These composites combine the advantages of electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, resulting in enhanced energy density. Layered double hydroxides, synthetic two-dimensional nano-structured anionic clays, can be used as hosts for Azo-compounds to create nano-hybrid materials and as fillers for poly vinyl alcohol to form nano-composites. The intercalation of an anionic pigment into Zn-Al LDH increases the interlayer spacing, and subsequent thermal analyses reveal complex host-guest interactions. The resulting nano-composite exhibits improved thermal stability compared to pure PVA, indicating the successful formation of a new material with enhanced properties. Specific material combinations can improve energy storage capabilities, whether through biomass-derived carbon composites for supercapacitors or layered double hydroxide-based nano-composites.
