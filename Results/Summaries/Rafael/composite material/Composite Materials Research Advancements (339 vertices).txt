Composite materials have various applications in different fields. Dental composites are popular as filling materials due to their good qualities and ongoing research for improvement, with a new composite helping prevent dental caries by neutralizing salivary pH. Textile composite materials used in high-temperature environments have a six-level structure and mathematical models to analyze their mechanical and thermal properties, with different types of destruction and corresponding failure criteria. A wood-polymer composite material has been developed for thermal insulation, aiming to improve operational properties and reduce market value. Energy-saving in the construction industry emphasizes the use of secondary products in building materials production to address environmental concerns and resource depletion. Material and field factors impact cement compositions, with the use of limestone waste and combined ultrasound and magnetic field treatment enhancing the strength of cement systems. New technologies and materials are important in addressing scientific and practical challenges. The fatigue strength of composite materials has been explored through experimental data, a fatigue strength criterion, and damage accumulation curves. Digital micrograph analysis provides insights into how different types of external impacts affect composite parameters.
