Biomass-derived carbons and their composites are being utilized for high-performance supercapacitors, with conductive additives like metals, metal sulfides, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide enhancing conductivity and charge storage capabilities. These composites combine the benefits of electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, leading to improved energy density. Layered double hydroxides, synthetic two-dimensional nano-structured anionic clays, are being used as hosts for Azo-compounds to create nano-hybrid materials and as fillers for poly vinyl alcohol to form nano-composites, exhibiting improved thermal stability. The development and application of these advanced materials highlight their potential in energy storage and composite technologies, demonstrating the diverse applications of nano-structured materials in enhancing performance and stability.
