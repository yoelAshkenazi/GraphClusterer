Composite materials, their properties, and applications cover a wide range of topics. Dental caries and the use of composite materials in dentistry highlight the importance of choosing the right material for tooth restoration, including a new composite that helps neutralize salivary pH to prevent caries development. Textile composite materials used in high-temperature environments have a six-level structure and mathematical models for analyzing their mechanical and thermal properties, and may experience different types of destruction. A layered wood-polymer composite material for thermal insulation aims to improve operational properties and reduce costs. Energy-saving in the construction industry emphasizes the importance of using secondary products and sustainable practices to address environmental concerns. Limestone waste in cement compositions can enhance the properties of cement stone and improve the overall composition. The application of ultrasound and magnetic fields to cement compositions leads to increased strength in hardened cement systems. Progress in material development is driven by new technologies and the need to address diverse challenges. Fatigue strength in composite materials presents a fatigue strength criterion and analyzes damage accumulation, and a method for studying this has been introduced.
