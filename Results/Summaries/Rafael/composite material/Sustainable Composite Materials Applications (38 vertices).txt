Composite materials and their applications are discussed in terms of sustainability, dynamic properties, and analytical modeling. Green composite materials, including metallic, polymer, and cement-based composites, offer environmental benefits and mechanical properties, with a focus on green metal-matrix composites and their fabrication techniques. Dynamic materials, particularly those with vibrational dynamics, can change properties under vibration, as seen in the example of a pipe conveying pulsating fluid. Viscoelastic composite materials are used in construction, applying viscoelastic equations and principles. Graphene and its derivatives serve as effective nanofillers in polymers, enhancing their properties for industrial applications, with a focus on synthesis methods, modification routes, and the impact on polymer matrix properties. Analytical models evaluate residual stresses in polymeric composite materials, emphasizing the importance of accurately describing the polymer matrix behavior during curing, and a modified classical laminate theory model accounts for resin chemical shrinkage. Composite materials also play a role in increasing load capacity in railroad systems, involving static analysis, finite element modeling, and full-scale testing, resulting in improved load capacity and validated analytical models.
