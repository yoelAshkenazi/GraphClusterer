The efficient recycling of composite materials, especially those used in automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy sectors, is a significant challenge due to their complex nature, particularly for thermoset-based polymer composites. This is becoming increasingly important due to waste management regulations and the need for resource and energy conservation. Various recycling methods like mechanical, thermal, and chemical processes have been developed, but they primarily focus on reinforcement fibers and face barriers to commercialization due to high costs, limited markets, and reduced recyclate quality. Research and development efforts are crucial for creating innovative, easily recyclable composite materials and advanced separation technologies, including optimizing design, manufacturing, and end-of-life management processes. A fatigue damage model for composite materials has been developed, which accurately predicts the progressive degradation of mechanical properties under cyclic loading, and has been validated using experimental data, demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding the damage evolution and accumulation in composites subjected to variable loading conditions.
