Composite materials have seen rapid expansion due to the development of 3D printing technology and the need for materials with enhanced properties in modern applications. A wide range of topics are covered, from the basic introduction to composite materials and their applications in aerospace engineering to the development of new composite materials for specific purposes, such as radiation protection, ballistic applications, and construction. Understanding the relationship between materials and design, especially in the context of ergonomics, is emphasized, with a need for innovative design activities that integrate ergodesign. The development of composite materials for aerospace engineering is exemplified, where carbon fiber composites replace metal alloys due to their weight-saving advantages. The synthesis and modeling of composite materials is also explored, focusing on computer-based modeling to study their properties, and the principle of simulability is introduced. The importance of using composite materials in construction is highlighted, particularly in strengthening building frameworks and creating new building materials, with applications in lightweight concrete, asphalt concrete, and building materials made from industrial waste.
