The use of composite materials in various industries, such as automotive and aerospace, is widespread, but their recycling remains a challenge due to their complex nature, especially for thermoset-based polymer composites. Recycling is important for resource and energy conservation, in line with waste management regulations. Current recycling methods, including mechanical, thermal, and chemical processes, primarily target reinforcement fibers, but face challenges in commercialization due to high costs and quality concerns. Continued research and development are needed to create more recyclable composites and efficient separation technologies. A collaborative approach involving design, manufacturing, and end-of-life management can lead to better recycling solutions. A fatigue damage model for composite materials considers stiffness degradation and two material parameters related to fatigue life and loading levels, accurately predicting damage evolution and material life under variable loading conditions, contributing to a better understanding of composite material behavior under cyclic loading and providing a valuable tool for predicting their fatigue life.
