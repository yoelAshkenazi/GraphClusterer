Composite materials' development and application are explored through their properties, production methods, and potential uses in various industries, emphasizing the importance of understanding the relationship between materials and design, particularly in ergonomics. The use of composite materials in construction, aerospace, and other industries is discussed, highlighting their advantages over traditional materials, such as carbon fiber composites' weight-saving properties and advanced composites' improved performance and reduced life-cycle costs in satellite systems, military aircraft, and commercial transport. The science behind composite materials is also delved into, including their structure, properties, and production challenges, covering topics such as inclusion particles and composite matrix interaction, fibers and fillers' effects on composite properties, and mathematical models for predicting composite characteristics. Research on utilizing waste materials, like phosphogypsum, in composite building materials addresses environmental concerns and cost-effectiveness, while the use of micro- and nanosize particles, like whiskers, as reinforcement fibers enhances initial materials' properties. A systemic approach is emphasized for studying composite materials as complex systems with corresponding attributes, proposing methodologies like the principle of simulability for researching composites.
