Composite materials, widely used in industries like automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy, pose a recycling challenge due to their complex nature, especially for thermoset-based polymer composites. Current and future waste management regulations mandate proper recovery and recycling of all engineering materials from end-of-life products, with benefits including resource and energy conservation. Various recycling technologies, primarily focusing on reinforcement fibers, have been developed, but are not yet widely commercialized due to market, cost, and quality-related hurdles. Research and development aim to create more recyclable composites and efficient separation technologies. Composite mechanical properties are affected by cyclic loading, and a fatigue damage model with material parameters influencing fatigue life and loading levels has been introduced, successfully predicting composite stiffness degradation and damage evolution, as validated by experimental data, and accurately predicting the life of composites under two-level loading conditions.
