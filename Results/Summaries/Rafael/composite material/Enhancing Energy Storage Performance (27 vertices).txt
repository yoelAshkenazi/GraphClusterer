The utilization of specific materials can enhance the performance of energy storage devices, particularly supercapacitors. Biomass-derived carbons and their composites with conductive materials, such as metals, metal sulfides, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide, can reduce internal resistance, leading to improved charge/discharge capabilities and higher specific capacitance values. These composites combine the energy storage mechanisms of electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, resulting in increased energy density. Layered double hydroxides, synthetic nano-structured anionic clays, can form nano-hybrid and nano-composite materials with improved thermal stability. Material engineering and composite formation are crucial in improving the performance of energy storage systems, particularly in the context of supercapacitors and nano-structured materials.
