Studies cover a range of topics related to wind and its interaction with structures, including investigations into wind speed and sediment flux profiles over different vegetation types, heat transfer and convection in cold-region railway tunnels, the impact of crosswinds on high-speed trains in bridge-tunnel sections, machine learning applications for predicting wind pressure on buildings, renewable energy harvesting for railway tunnel monitoring, fire safety in tunnels under natural ventilation, and the prevention of ballast flying in high-speed railway tunnels. These studies employ various methods, such as wind tunnel tests, numerical simulations, machine learning techniques, and experimental setups, to analyze and address specific challenges in each context. Wind tunnel observations and field measurements are used to understand wind and sediment flux profiles over vegetation, while computational fluid dynamics models and wind barrier designs are applied to improve high-speed train safety in crosswind environments. Machine learning, particularly GANs, is utilized to predict wind pressure coefficients on buildings, and a portable renewable wind energy harvesting system is proposed for powering monitoring sensors in remote railway tunnels. The results offer valuable insights for engineering applications, such as designing windbreaks, improving temperature field predictions in cold-region tunnel design, enhancing train safety with wind barriers, and reducing the cost of wind tunnel tests for building design.
