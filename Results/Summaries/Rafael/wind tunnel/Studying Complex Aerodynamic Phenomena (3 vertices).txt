Experimental and analytical methods are used to study the aerodynamics of various objects, including a delta wing, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and an iced cable model of a cable-stayed bridge. A simple analytical model simulates the complex dynamics of a delta wing installed at high incidence in a wind tunnel, aiding in the understanding of nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamics. Specialized laboratory setups are needed to study UAV characteristics, as traditional wind tunnels lack the capability to adjust airflow speed and assess the impact of the center of mass position, which are crucial for modern UAV flight dynamics research. A novel laboratory stand and methodology address these challenges. Wind tunnel experiments determine the Strouhal number of an iced cable model, created using 3D printing based on the shape obtained through numerical photogrammetry. These studies contribute to the understanding of aerodynamics and the development of improved methods for analyzing complex aerodynamic phenomena.
