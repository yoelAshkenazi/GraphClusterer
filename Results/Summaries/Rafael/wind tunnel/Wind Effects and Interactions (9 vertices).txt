Wind effects are investigated in various contexts through multiple studies. One study finds that wind speed and sediment flux profiles have similar structures across different plant morphologies and wind velocities. A finite-difference model is used to analyze the temperature field distribution under varying wind conditions in a cold-region railway tunnel, focusing on heat convection and transfer. The impact of a wind barrier on high-speed trains' safety in a bridge-tunnel section is examined, showing a significant reduction in the sharp change effect of the aerodynamic coefficient. Machine learning techniques, such as backpropagation neural networks and generative adversarial networks, predict wind pressure coefficients on building surfaces, reducing the need for extensive wind tunnel tests. A portable renewable wind energy harvesting system is proposed to power monitoring sensors in remote areas, addressing high-speed railway safety. A numerical simulation explores the effect of strong environmental wind on a tunnel fire under natural ventilation, while another study introduces a method to mitigate ballast flying risk in high-speed railway tunnels. A chemically nonequilibrium air plasma simulation in a high-enthalpy wind tunnel validates the heat flux and pressure distributions over a cone surface, contributing to a deeper understanding of wind interactions in diverse engineering and environmental contexts.
