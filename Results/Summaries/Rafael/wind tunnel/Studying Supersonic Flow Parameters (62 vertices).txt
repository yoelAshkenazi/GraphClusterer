Wind tunnel experiments have various applications, including studying supersonic flows with Mach numbers below 4, focusing on the starting processes, and developing digital Mach number regulators for supersonic periodic wind tunnels to control airflow in subsonic regimes. An algorithm for calculating flow parameters in hypersonic wind tunnels considers real gas properties and is validated through experimental measurements. Aeration modeling in quarries utilizes a closed-circuit wind tunnel to study air currents and the effectiveness of guiding devices, exploring design and modeling techniques. The color shadow method is a technique used to investigate non-stationary gas-dynamic processes, showcasing its potential through various schemes and applications in complex flow scenarios. These experiments highlight the importance of advanced control systems, algorithms, and visualization techniques in studying supersonic and hypersonic flows and modeling aeration in quarries.
