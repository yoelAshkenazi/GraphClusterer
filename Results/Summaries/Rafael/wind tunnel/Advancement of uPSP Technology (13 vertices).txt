The advancement of Unsteady Pressure-Sensitive Paint (uPSP) technology offers a unique approach to measuring surface pressure fluctuations with both high-frequency and high-spatial resolution, making it a valuable tool for aerospace vehicle aerodynamics research. A rigorous calibration and validation process for uPSP measurements is crucial for its accurate application in wind tunnel testing, involving comparing uPSP-derived data to traditional pressure transducer measurements by considering camera measurement errors, flow field pressure variations, and the data reduction process. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through experiments in a small-scale wind tunnel and during a Space Launch System test at NASA's Ames Research Center, showcasing the technology's potential for enhancing our understanding of unsteady aerodynamics, and this validation process is essential to ensure the reliability and widespread adoption of uPSP technology in the field of aerospace engineering.
