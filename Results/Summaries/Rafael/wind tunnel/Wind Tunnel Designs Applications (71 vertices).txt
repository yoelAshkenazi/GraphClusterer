Various wind tunnel designs, models, and experiments are discussed for applications including power generation, wind energy production, aerodynamic testing, and flow visualization. A novel wind tunnel with a conical and elevation structure uses a sucking fan to simulate wind and a wind turbine to generate electricity, with its performance compared to a straight conical structure. The concept of a "wind dam" is explored, harnessing wind energy from natural barriers like hills, with investigations into geometrical parameters, tunnel shape, wind turbine addition, and incident wind velocity and profile. 3D printing technology is used to create wind tunnel models, comparing aerodynamic performances with traditional metal models, showing close similarities in drag and lift forces. A multipurpose wind tunnel with an adjustable test section can function as an environmental, subsonic, or climatic wind tunnel, with computational fluid dynamics used to analyze flow properties and flow.
