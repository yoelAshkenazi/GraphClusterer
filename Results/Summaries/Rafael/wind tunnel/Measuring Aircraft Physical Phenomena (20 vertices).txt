Advanced techniques for measuring and analyzing various physical phenomena on aircraft models in wind tunnels include the use of luminescent sensor paint for quantitative pressure measurement, which has advantages such as fast response time, stability, and high accuracy, compared to traditional pressure tap techniques. This method is effective when applied to a large sensing surface in a transonic wind tunnel. Temperature Sensitive Paint (TSP) technology is used to study boundary layer transition in short-duration wind tunnels, with experiments conducted at high Mach and Reynolds numbers on flat plates to investigate both natural and induced boundary layer transitions. These techniques offer valuable insights into aircraft aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, providing data that was previously difficult or impossible to obtain.
