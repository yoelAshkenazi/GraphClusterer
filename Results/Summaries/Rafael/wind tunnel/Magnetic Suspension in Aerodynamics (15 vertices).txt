Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) for wind tunnels represent a significant advancement in aerodynamics, addressing critical challenges that traditional methods cannot overcome. These systems enable precise measurement of aerodynamic forces on aircraft models without interference from mechanical supports, and investigation of base pressure crucial for aircraft design. The electromagnetic setup, position sensing mechanisms, and control and calibration systems of two wind tunnel MSBS have been detailed, along with intricate aspects of high-angle-of-attack control and roll control essential for understanding complex aerodynamic phenomena. Researchers have also focused on ABS plastics and their potential use in manufacturing aerodynamic models for wind tunnel testing, evaluating physical and mechanical properties at normal and negative temperatures to determine feasibility for creating various models that ensure structural integrity and suitability for wind tunnel experiments, contributing to advancing wind tunnel testing capabilities for more accurate and comprehensive aerodynamic assessments.
