Wind tunnels and wind-related phenomena are studied and applied in various ways. Studies investigate wind speed and sediment flux profiles in different vegetation types, finding similarities in profile structures across plant morphologies and wind velocities. Heat convection and transfer in a cold-region railway tunnel are examined, with a computer model developed to accurately predict the temperature field distribution. The impact of a wind barrier on high-speed trains in a bridge-tunnel section is explored, reducing aerodynamic coefficient changes and improving safety. Machine learning techniques predict wind pressure coefficients on buildings, with a GANs model showing the best performance and potential for reducing wind tunnel test costs. A portable renewable wind energy harvesting system is proposed for powering monitoring sensors in high-speed railway tunnels, offering a self-powered solution. The impact of environmental wind on tunnel fires is examined, providing insights for fire protection design. A method to prevent ballast flying in high-speed railway tunnels is introduced, and a numerical simulation of chemically nonequilibrium air plasma in a high-enthalpy wind tunnel is presented, validating experimental results. These studies highlight the diverse applications of wind tunnel studies and simulations in understanding and mitigating wind-related challenges.
