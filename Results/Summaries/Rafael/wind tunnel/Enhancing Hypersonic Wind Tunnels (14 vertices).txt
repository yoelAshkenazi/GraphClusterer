Enhancing the Reynolds number in hypersonic wind tunnels is a key focus, with various methods being explored to achieve this. Analytical and numerical studies evaluate different approaches to increase the Re number, considering real gas effects, stagnation pressures, temperatures, and Mach numbers, concluding that increasing stagnation pressure is the preferred method for specific nozzle exit diameters and test durations. The IT-302M hotshot wind tunnel has capabilities in modeling high-velocity flows, including external and attached pipeline flow regimes with specific pressure and temperature parameters, with achievements such as obtaining positive thrust force in a scramjet model and comparing inlet flow results between different wind tunnel types. A short-duration wind tunnel with opposing pistons of pressure multipliers is also introduced, emphasizing the importance of optimizing wind tunnel designs and operations to improve the accuracy of high-velocity flow modeling and testing.
