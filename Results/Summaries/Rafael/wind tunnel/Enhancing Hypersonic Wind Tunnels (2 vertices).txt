Methods to enhance the Reynolds number in hypersonic wind tunnels aim to improve the modeling of high-velocity flows. Analytical and numerical studies explored different approaches to increase the Re number, considering factors such as real gas effects, stagnation pressures, temperatures, and Mach numbers. The preferred method identified is increasing the stagnation pressure of the test gas, particularly for specific nozzle exit diameters and test durations. The IT-302M hotshot wind tunnel models various flow regimes with a wide range of parameters, including high total pressures and temperatures, achieving unique results like generating positive thrust force in a scramjet model and conducting comparative tests between hotshot and blow-down wind tunnels. The concept of a short-duration wind tunnel with opposing pistons of pressure multipliers has been introduced as a potential solution, contributing to the development of more efficient and versatile wind tunnels for hypersonic flow research.
