Two separate research studies focused on understanding and quantifying the movement and deposition of airborne particles under different conditions. The use of windbreaks was explored as a means to reduce pesticide drift and its impact on honey bees, with experiments in a wind tunnel revealing that needle-like foliage of windbreak trees is more effective at capturing spray than broad-leaved varieties, thus reducing potential exposure to honey bees. Flying bees capture slightly more spray than stationary bees at lower wind speeds. The efficiency of BEST sediment traps in capturing sand particles transported by wind-driven rain was also investigated using a wind tunnel rainfall simulator, revealing high integrated efficiencies under various wind velocities and rain intensities. These studies contribute to a better understanding of particle movement and deposition, with potential applications in agriculture and environmental protection.
