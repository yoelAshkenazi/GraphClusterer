Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) for wind tunnels is a significant advancement in aerodynamics, aiming to address critical challenges that traditional methods cannot overcome, with two primary objectives: accurately measuring aerodynamic forces on aircraft models without interference from mechanical supports, and studying base pressure. This technology involves intricate electromagnetic configurations, position sensing mechanisms, and control and calibration processes, and has been established in two wind tunnel MSBS systems in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which can control high angles of attack and roll, with preliminary experimental results. Researchers have also investigated using ABS plastics in additive manufacturing of aerodynamic models for wind tunnel testing, examining the material's physical and mechanical properties at normal and negative temperatures, revealing unique structural characteristics and failure modes, to determine the feasibility of employing ABS plastic for creating various models used in wind tunnel experiments, potentially offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for aerodynamic testing.
