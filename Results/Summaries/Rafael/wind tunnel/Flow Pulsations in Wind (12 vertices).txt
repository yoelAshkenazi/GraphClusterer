The research focuses on understanding the relationship between flow pulsations in a settling chamber and the resulting supersonic flow in a wind tunnel. The T-325 wind tunnel at ITAM SB RAS was used to collect experimental data, revealing insights into the correlation between flow pulsations and the effectiveness of turbulence reduction systems. A three-channel hot-wire measurement system was employed to study subsonic and supersonic flows, providing valuable data for analyzing flow behavior in different sections of the wind tunnel. The primary goal of this work is to enhance the understanding of flow dynamics and improve the efficiency of turbulence reduction techniques in wind tunnel experiments. By studying the relationship between flow pulsations, researchers can optimize the design and operation of wind tunnels, ensuring more accurate and controlled flow conditions for various aerodynamic testing purposes.
