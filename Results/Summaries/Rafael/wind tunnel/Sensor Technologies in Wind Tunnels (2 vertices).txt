Specialized sensor technologies are used for pressure and boundary layer measurements in wind tunnel experiments. A luminescent sensor paint applied to aircraft models offers advantages such as fast response time, stability, and high accuracy for quantitative pressure measurements in transonic wind tunnels, with results comparable to traditional pressure tap techniques, and provides valuable data in shock wind tunnels at high Mach numbers. Temperature-Sensitive Paint technology is utilized to study boundary layer transition on flat plates in short-duration wind tunnels, enabling the investigation of both natural and induced boundary layer transitions at various Mach and Reynolds numbers, enhancing the understanding of fluid dynamics and aerodynamic phenomena in wind tunnel testing.
