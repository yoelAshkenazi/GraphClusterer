Wind tunnel experiments and their applications are discussed in various aspects. Vacuum wind tunnels are used for studying supersonic flows with Mach numbers M < 4, highlighting the starting processes in such tunnels. A digital Mach number regulator is proposed for a specific type of supersonic wind tunnel, detailing its development, mathematical modeling, and in-situ testing. An algorithm for calculating flow parameters in hypersonic wind tunnels is introduced, considering real gas properties, and validated through experimental measurements. Aeration modeling in quarries is studied using a closed-circuit wind tunnel to evaluate guiding device effectiveness. The potential of artificial intelligence in wind tunnel testing is explored, suggesting deterministic and variable-structure models and addressing hardware realization and efficiency evaluation. The color shadow method is described for investigating non-stationary gasdynamic processes in wind tunnels, showcasing its application in studying complex gas flow patterns and interactions. These studies collectively showcase the diverse applications and methodologies employed in wind tunnel experiments, ranging from supersonic flow studies to the implementation of advanced modeling and measurement techniques.
