Various wind tunnel experiments and their applications are discussed. The use of a vacuum wind tunnel for studying supersonic flows, focusing on starting processes, aims to develop and test a digital Mach number regulator for a specific wind tunnel type. An algorithm for calculating flow parameters in hypersonic wind tunnels, using air and carbon dioxide, is described and verified through experimental measurements. Aeration modelling in quarries is studied using a closed-circuit wind tunnel to investigate air current aerodynamics and the effectiveness of guiding devices. The potential of artificial intelligence in wind tunnel testing is explored, proposing different intelligence models and considering hardware realization and efficiency evaluation. The color shadow method is presented for investigating non-stationary gasdynamic processes in wind tunnels, showcasing its application in studying complex gas flow patterns and interactions using various shadow devices. These experiments collectively highlight the diverse techniques and methodologies employed in wind tunnel research, covering topics from supersonic flow regulation to artificial intelligence integration and gas flow visualization.
