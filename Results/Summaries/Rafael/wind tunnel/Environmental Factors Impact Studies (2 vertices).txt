Scientific experiments investigating the interaction between environmental factors and various objects focus on measurement and data collection. Experiments examine pesticide deposition on windbreak tree species and its potential impact on honey bees, finding that needle-like foliage captures more spray than broad-leaves, and flying bees capture more spray at lower wind speeds compared to bees at rest. The wind-driven rain transport process and the efficiency of sediment traps in capturing sand particles are also explored, with wind tunnel experiments determining that the integrated efficiency of sediment traps remains relatively consistent across different wind velocities and rain intensities, with slight variations observed. These studies contribute to understanding environmental processes and their effects on different elements, providing valuable data for further research and potential applications in agriculture and environmental management.
