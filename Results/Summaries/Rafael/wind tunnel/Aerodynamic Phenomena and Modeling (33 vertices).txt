Wind tunnel experiments and modeling are used to study various aerodynamic phenomena. A simple analytical model replicates chaotic behavior in a delta wing's dynamics at high incidence, validating methods for understanding complex aerodynamics. A novel laboratory setup and methodology for researching unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) addresses the need for experimental studies during UAV development, highlighting the importance of controlling airflow speed and studying the center of mass position for evaluating UAV flight dynamics. Advanced techniques like numerical photogrammetry and 3D printing recreate an iced cable model in a wind tunnel study to determine the Strouhal number, a key parameter in understanding vortex shedding behind the model. The application of wind tunnel testing and modeling investigates different aerodynamic scenarios, from complex delta wing dynamics to UAV research and iced structure behavior, emphasizing innovative techniques and modeling approaches to accurately capture and predict aerodynamic characteristics.
