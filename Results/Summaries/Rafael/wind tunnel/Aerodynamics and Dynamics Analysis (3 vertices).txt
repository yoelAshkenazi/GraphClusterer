Experimental and analytical approaches are used to understand the aerodynamics and dynamics of various objects, including a delta wing, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and an iced cable model of a cable-stayed bridge. A simple analytical model simulates complex dynamics observed in wind tunnel tests for a delta wing, providing a valuable tool for nonlinear aerodynamics analysis. Specialized experimental setups are needed to study UAV characteristics, and a new laboratory stand concept addresses these challenges, emphasizing the importance of controlling air flow speed and studying the center of mass position for UAV research. Wind tunnel investigations of an iced cable model utilize a 3D-printed replica and a numerical photogrammetry method to determine the Strouhal number, crucial for understanding the aerodynamic behavior of such structures. Different methods are used to study and model complex aerodynamic phenomena, each with its unique focus and contribution to the field of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, emphasizing the importance of experimental techniques, mathematical modeling, and innovative research methodologies in advancing our understanding of aerodynamics in various applications.
