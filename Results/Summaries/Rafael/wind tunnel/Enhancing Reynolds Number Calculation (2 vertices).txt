Enhancing the Reynolds number in hypersonic wind tunnels is achieved by considering factors like real gas effects, stagnation pressures, temperatures, and Mach numbers, with increasing stagnation pressure being the preferred method for specific nozzle exit diameters and test durations. The IT-302M hotshot wind tunnel models high-velocity flows with Mach numbers ranging from 4 to 20 for external flows and 2 to 6 for attached pipeline flows, and has achieved unique results such as obtaining positive thrust force in a scramjet model and comparing inlet flow results between different wind tunnel types. The concept of a short-duration wind tunnel with opposing pistons is also introduced, highlighting advancements and innovations in wind tunnel technology for high-speed flow research.
