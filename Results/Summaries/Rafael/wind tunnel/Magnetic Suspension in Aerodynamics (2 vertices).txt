Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) for wind tunnels is a significant advancement in aerodynamics, aiming to address challenges that conventional methods cannot overcome, such as accurately measuring aerodynamic forces on aircraft models without interference from mechanical supports and investigating base pressure. The technology involves sophisticated electromagnetic configurations, position sensing mechanisms, and control and calibration processes, with two wind tunnel MSBS systems currently in operation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Researchers have also focused on understanding the physical and mechanical properties of ABS plastics for the production of aerodynamic models using additive manufacturing techniques, specifically FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), to assess the suitability of ABS plastic for creating models that can withstand wind tunnel testing conditions. This research involved testing ABS samples at normal and negative temperatures, analyzing their structural characteristics, and observing their failure modes to determine the potential of ABS plastic for use in various wind tunnel testing applications, including high-angle-of-attack control and roll control.
