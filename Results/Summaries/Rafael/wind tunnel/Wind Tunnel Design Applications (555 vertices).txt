Wind tunnel design, testing, and applications are discussed in various aspects. The primary focus is on wind tunnel models, with an emphasis on their construction, testing, and performance, exploring different materials, manufacturing techniques, and aerodynamic characteristics, highlighting the advantages of 3D printing technology in reducing costs and time compared to traditional metal models. Novel structures for power generation, natural barrier-based wind dams, and multipurpose wind tunnels with adjustable test sections are designed and evaluated to improve wind tunnel performance, reduce environmental impact, and enhance versatility. Wind tunnel applications include aerodynamic testing of aircraft models, bridge stability analysis, wind turbine performance, and the study of atmospheric boundary layers, emphasizing the importance of accurate wind tunnel models and testing conditions for reliable results. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and numerical simulations are used to analyze wind tunnel flows, validate experimental data, and optimize wind tunnel designs, demonstrating the effectiveness of CFD in wind tunnel research.
