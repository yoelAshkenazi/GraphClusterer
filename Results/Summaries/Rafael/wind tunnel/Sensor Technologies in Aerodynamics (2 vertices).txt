Specialized sensor technologies are used for quantitative and qualitative measurements in wind tunnel experiments. Luminescent sensor paint is applied for pressure measurements on aircraft models, offering advantages such as fast response time, stability, and high accuracy compared to traditional pressure tap techniques, allowing for detailed pressure distribution analysis on the model's surface. Temperature-Sensitive Paint technology is utilized to study boundary layer transition on flat plates in short-duration wind tunnels at high Mach and Reynolds numbers, enabling researchers to investigate both natural and induced boundary layer transitions, providing valuable insights into fluid dynamics and aerodynamics. Both techniques offer unique advantages for wind tunnel testing, enabling the collection of critical data that was previously challenging to obtain through conventional methods.
