Significant advancements and challenges have been seen in the field of nuclear reactors in recent years, with a focus on improving safety, efficiency, and sustainability. A comprehensive review of various nuclear reactor types, their applications, and the advantages and disadvantages of each highlights the importance of nuclear safety and its role in the development of nuclear reactors worldwide. Modular high-temperature nuclear reactors show potential for electricity and heat generation, as well as hydrogen production, with an algorithm calculating key reactor characteristics and comparing results for different fuel and reflector materials, finding uranium oxide more effective than metallic uranium and graphite the preferred reflector. The principles of nuclear reactions for energy generation, the nuclear fuel cycle, and various power reactor types are also covered, introducing the CYCLE code simulation tool for nuclear power systems. Molten salts as fuel and reprocessing media in molten salt reactors are discussed, along with the need for a database of nuclear-physical and physicochemical properties of molten salts, and the possibility of using minor actinides as fuel to reduce waste storage and economic pressure from natural uranium shortages is explored, leading to an innovative nuclear power technology based on modular fast-neutron reactors.
