Nuclear reactor technology is discussed with a focus on safety, control, and efficiency. The concept of using heat pipes as control devices in small nuclear reactors is introduced, which are part of the Generation IV initiative aiming to replace current reactor designs. The Directed Reactor Auxiliary Cooling System (DRACS) and its application in advanced high-temperature reactors and small modular reactors are also mentioned. Challenges and solutions in nuclear reactor control are addressed, including cooling nuclear fuel during accidents, emphasizing the role of thermal hydraulics in ensuring safety. Controlling axial power distribution in nuclear reactors to prevent xenon oscillations is also discussed, introducing an adaptive robust control method based on a multipoint kinetics reactor model. Accurate modeling for efficient and safe operation is highlighted, reviewing various modeling approaches, power control methods, and load-following control techniques. The concept of asymptotic limiting of nuclear reactor power and its impact on emergency protection systems is explored. Innovative control systems are proposed, including the use of the Quantitative Feedback Theory method (QFT) and the application of multilayer cellular neural networks (CNNs) to model and solve nuclear reactor dynamic equations, aiming to improve reactor control, particularly during load-following operations.
