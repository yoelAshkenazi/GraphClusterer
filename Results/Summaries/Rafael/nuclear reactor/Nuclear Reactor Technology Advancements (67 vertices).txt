Nuclear reactor technology has various aspects, including applications, advancements, and challenges, with topics such as reactor types, safety, fuel cycles, waste management, and research reactors being covered. A key theme is the need for nuclear reactors to address global warming and energy demands, with Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) having potential to reduce global warming effects and provide a sustainable energy source. Nuclear safety is emphasized, with discussions on the challenges of nuclear waste management and the potential use of minor actinides as fuel to reduce waste. Technical aspects of nuclear reactors, such as core design, fuel-to-moderator ratios, and the use of various materials and coolants, are also explored. The concept of hybrid thermonuclear reactors, modular high-temperature nuclear reactors (VHTR), and fast-neutron reactors with steam coolant are discussed, along with the role of fast sodium reactors in a two-component nuclear power system and the possibility of using molten salts as fuel and for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. Economic and safety aspects of nuclear power are also addressed, including the high cost of nuclear power plants and the need for improved safety measures, with proposals for innovative technologies.
