Various technological advancements and research efforts are being made in the field of nuclear energy and its applications. Nuclear reactors and desalination technology have potential in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, with different reactor types undergoing cost analysis. China is developing an accelerator-driven subcritical system for nuclear waste transmutation, including a lead-based reactor and experimental loops. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods are being used in nuclear reactor engineering for modeling and simulation of various reactor components and systems. Safety goals in fusion reactors are also being explored, with a review of historical safety goals for nuclear reactors and a proposed framework for fusion reactor safety, addressing occupational exposure, routine releases, accidents, and radioactive waste management. These efforts aim to improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability in the nuclear energy sector.
