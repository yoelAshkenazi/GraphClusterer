Various technological advancements and research efforts in the field of nuclear energy focus on safety, efficiency, and environmental impact. Nuclear reactor technology has potential in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, for desalination purposes, and a techno-economic analysis of specific reactors has been presented. China has made progress in developing an accelerator-driven subcritical system for nuclear waste transmutation, including the construction of experimental loops and the design of a lead-based reactor. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods are used in nuclear reactor engineering to model complex two-phase phenomena and thermal-hydraulic features, with proposed future directions for its implementation. Establishing safety goals for fusion reactors is important, and a framework has been provided to guide future fusion reactor designs to ensure occupational safety, manage radioactive waste, and prevent accidents. These efforts collectively emphasize the ongoing improvements to nuclear technology, with a strong emphasis on safety and environmental considerations.
