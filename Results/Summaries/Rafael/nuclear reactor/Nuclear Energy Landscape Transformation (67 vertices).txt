The global nuclear energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, with a focus on addressing key challenges and advancing innovative technologies. Nuclear reactors are gaining attention as a potential solution to mitigate global warming, with various types and classifications introduced, and the discussion revolves around the advantages and disadvantages of different reactor designs, emphasizing the importance of nuclear safety. The use of advanced technologies, such as modular high-temperature nuclear reactors, is proposed to enhance safety and provide a comprehensive energy solution. Technical aspects of nuclear reactor design, including fuel-to-moderator volume ratios, neutron flux distribution, and criticality calculations, are crucial for optimizing reactor performance and ensuring safety. Computational tools, such as the CYCLE code, are used for simulating and analyzing nuclear power systems. The management of nuclear waste is a critical issue, with spent nuclear fuel posing environmental risks, and the potential of using minor actinides as fuel in nuclear reactors is explored to reduce waste storage and minimize economic pressure. The development of closed nuclear fuel cycles with fast reactors addresses issues related to spent nuclear fuel, nuclear fuel efficiency, and heat-exchange equipment, and the use of molten salts as fuel and reprocessing media is investigated, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive database of nuclear-physical and physicochemical properties.
