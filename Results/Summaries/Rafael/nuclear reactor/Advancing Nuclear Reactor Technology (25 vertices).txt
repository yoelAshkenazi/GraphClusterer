Nuclear reactor technology is being advanced to improve safety, efficiency, and control in nuclear power plants, driven by increasing global energy demands. The development of innovative nuclear energy systems, such as Generation IV reactors, aims to replace current Gen II/III reactors with more sustainable, clean, and safe designs, including the pebble-bed reactor and the use of heat pipes as control devices for small reactors. Safety is a critical concern, with a focus on thermal hydraulics for cooling extremely hot nuclear fuel during accidents, and the introduction of passive safety systems, small modular reactors, and improved reactor designs requires new methods for heat transmission and nuclear safety systems. Power control and load-following operation are also crucial, with various control strategies being introduced, such as adaptive robust control and feedback-linearization control, to manage power distribution and prevent instability in pressurized water reactors and VVER-1000 nuclear reactors. The modeling of reactor cores is a significant area of research, with point reactor core modeling and multi-point kinetics reactor modeling being explored.
