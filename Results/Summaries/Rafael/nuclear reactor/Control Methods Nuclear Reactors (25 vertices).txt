Nuclear power generation involves various aspects, including improving safety, efficiency, and control in nuclear reactors. Generation IV nuclear energy systems utilize heat pipes for control and the Directed Reactor Auxiliary Cooling System (DRACS) for advanced high-temperature reactors. Thermal hydraulics plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants, particularly in addressing the challenge of cooling extremely hot nuclear fuel during accidents. Control methods, such as adaptive robust control and robust observer-based nonlinear control, are proposed to regulate power distribution and ensure safe operation during load-following operations. Advanced technologies for modeling and controlling reactor cores cover power control, load-following control, and modeling approaches. Emergency protection systems are essential to prevent the failure of the emergency protection function during staged insertion of large negative reactivity. Robust control methods using Quantitative Feedback Theory and balance model reduction techniques are presented for power control systems. A novel method using three-dimensional multilayer cellular neural networks models and solves spatio-temporal behavior of nuclear reactor cores, offering a comprehensive approach to dynamic calculations.
