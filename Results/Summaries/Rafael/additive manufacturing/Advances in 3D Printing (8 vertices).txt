3D printing technology is advancing and being applied across various fields, with the potential to revolutionize manufacturing processes. In electronics and energy devices, particularly batteries, different 3D printing methods are being used, impacting battery performance, but challenges and future prospects remain. 3D food printing is also being explored, with a focus on customization, on-demand production, and geometric complexity, as seen in examples like pizza and grain-based products. A high-throughput fabrication technique using two-photon lithography has been developed for submicrometer additive manufacturing, enhancing speed and geometric design capabilities. 3D-printed epoxy is being developed for composite tooling applications, emphasizing the importance of material formulation. 3D-printed SubMiniature version A connectors have been designed and tested for radio-frequency applications, showcasing their flexibility, performance, and mechanical strength. 3D printing is also being used in energy storage devices, particularly supercapacitors, with benefits including 3D-printed electrodes, and research is ongoing with future directions suggested. Functional lithography resins have been used to successfully produce 3D printing production parts with superior physical and chemical properties. An automated testing and characterization method for additive manufacturing has been proposed to reduce costs and integrate.
