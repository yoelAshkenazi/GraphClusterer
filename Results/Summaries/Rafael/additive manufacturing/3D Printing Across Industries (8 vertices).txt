3D printing technology has various applications across industries. In manufacturing, it is used to create complex-shaped electronics, such as batteries, with different methods affecting performance and durability. In the food industry, 3D printing enables customization, on-demand production, and complex geometric shapes, as seen in 3D printed pizzas. A high-throughput fabrication technique, two-photon lithography, creates nanoscale features in 3D structures, addressing speed limitations through parallelization. Optimizing 3D printing parameters for epoxy systems can scale up the process for large-scale epoxy printing in composite tooling applications. 3D printed SubMiniature version A connectors for radio-frequency applications demonstrate mechanical strength and RF performance. 3D printing also manufactures customized energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors, with a focus on electrodes, materials, and fabrication processes. A successful case study by polySpectra developed a 3D printing process for functional lithography resins, resulting in parts with superior physical and chemical properties.
