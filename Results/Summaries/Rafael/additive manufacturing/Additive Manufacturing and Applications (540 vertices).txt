Additive manufacturing, also known as three-dimensional printing, has become a widely adopted production technique in various industries, enabling the creation of complex three-dimensional parts by gradually adding materials layer by layer. This technology has seen significant growth and innovation in recent years, with applications spanning from rapid prototyping to the production of intricate and customized parts. The versatility of additive manufacturing is demonstrated through its ability to work with a diverse range of materials, including metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites, each offering unique properties and performance. Additive manufacturing processes can be categorized into seven groups, with four of these being particularly well-suited for metal processing, including Powder Bed Fusion, Direct Energy Deposition, Binder Jetting, and Sheet Lamination. The applications of additive manufacturing are far-reaching, with notable uses in the medical field, aerospace and defense industries, automotive, jewelry, and construction industries, among others. The advantages of additive manufacturing are numerous, including design flexibility, material efficiency, and the ability to create complex geometries.
