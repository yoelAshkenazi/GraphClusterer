Additive manufacturing has been a game-changer in the production of various materials, including cermets and polymer-based composites, offering significant advantages over conventional methods, such as cost-effectiveness and the ability to create complex structures with high precision. The utilization of additive manufacturing techniques for producing cermet and polymeric components has gained attention in recent years due to their unique properties and potential applications. For cermets, processes like selective laser sintering/melting, laser engineering net shaping, and direct laser fabrication have been explored to create bulk cermet parts and overcome the limitations of traditional manufacturing processes. Research efforts have been dedicated to understanding and optimizing these processes for cermet fabrication. For polymeric composites, techniques such as stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused filament fabrication, fused deposition modeling, and binder jetting have been employed, offering advantages like improved mechanical properties and the ability to create intricate designs. The benefits, limitations, and future prospects of additive manufacturing-fabricated polymeric composites have been explored, considering potential applications in biomedical, automotive, and aerospace fields, highlighting the growing importance of additive manufacturing in advancing material science and engineering.
