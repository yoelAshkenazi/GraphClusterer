Additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D printing technologies have the potential to revolutionize multiple industries, and are seen as a key component of Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0, integrating Industry 4.0 and sustainability principles. AM offers advantages in creating complex geometries, reducing waste, and improving product performance and customization. Various AM processes, including selective laser melting and coaxial laser melting for metal parts, and inkjet printing for optics, are being improved for process efficiency, cost reduction, and product quality enhancement. AM is being applied in construction, biomedical, and aerospace fields, such as 3D printing with concrete for unique structural elements, producing biodegradable metals for bone substitution, and developing multifunctional porous nitinol for orthopedic implants. However, challenges including high production costs, residual stress, and anisotropic mechanical properties in metal AM remain, and can be addressed through beamless metal AM techniques and improved process control, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive system engineering and design approaches.
