Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has gained significant traction across various industries due to its ability to produce complex 3D structures with customizable properties. The origins of AM can be traced back to the 1980s, with the invention of stereolithography in Japan, and since then, numerous techniques have been developed, including selective laser sintering. The potential of AM in medical applications has been a growing area of interest, with research highlighting its ability to create personalized implants, prosthetics, and medical devices, such as customized dentures in dentistry. Different types of AM processes, including powder bed fusion, direct energy deposition, binder jetting, and sheet lamination, each have their own advantages and limitations, and can be used to create complex 3D structures with precise control over material properties, making them ideal for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The potential of AM also extends to the aerospace and defense industries, where it can be used to create complex parts with improved mechanical properties, although challenges remain.
