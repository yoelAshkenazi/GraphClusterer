Additive manufacturing has emerged as a transformative approach in the production of advanced materials, offering distinct advantages over conventional processes. The utilization of additive manufacturing techniques for creating cermets and polymeric composites, both widely used in diverse industries, has been explored. Additive manufacturing methods like selective laser sintering/melting, laser engineering net shaping, and binder jet 3D printing have been used to overcome the limitations of traditional manufacturing, allowing for the production of bulk cermet components with enhanced properties. Additive manufacturing has also been instrumental in fabricating complex polymer-based parts with precision, while being cost-effective. Techniques such as stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused filament fabrication, fused deposition modeling, and binder jetting have been employed to create high-performance polymeric composites, offering improved properties for applications in biomedical, automotive, and aerospace sectors. The advantages, disadvantages, and future prospects of additive manufacturing in producing these advanced materials emphasize the potential for innovation in various industries.
