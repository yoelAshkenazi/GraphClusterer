Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has revolutionized the manufacturing process by enabling the creation of complex, customized parts and products through layer-by-layer material addition. This technology has found applications in diverse fields, including aerospace, automotive, medical, and electronics, among others. The history and development of additive manufacturing date back to the 1980s with the invention of stereolithography and subsequent advancements in various 3D printing techniques. The versatility of additive manufacturing lies in its ability to utilize a wide range of materials, such as polymers, metals, ceramics, and composites, for different applications. Various additive manufacturing processes, including selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, electron beam melting, powder bed fusion, direct energy deposition, binder jetting, and material jetting, are used, each with its operational concepts, advantages, and limitations. Additive manufacturing is extensively used in the medical field for producing implants, prosthetics, and tissue engineering scaffolds, enabling the creation of patient-specific devices and implants that offer improved functionality and personalized treatment options. It is also used in dental applications, such as fabricating dentures and dental implants.
