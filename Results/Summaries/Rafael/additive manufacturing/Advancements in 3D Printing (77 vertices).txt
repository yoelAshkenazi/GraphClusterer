Advancements and potential of 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), are being explored across various fields, including electronics, energy storage, food production, and material science. In electronics, 3D printing is used to create complex-shaped batteries, with different printing methods employed to fabricate battery electrodes and electrolytes, and progress and challenges are being made in developing 3D-printed batteries with improved performance and safety. 3D printing is also being used in the food industry to customize and create geometrically complex food items, such as pizza, with enhanced texture and nutritional properties. The development of novel functional lithography resins, combined with efficient printing processes, results in parts with superior physical and chemical properties, making additive manufacturing a viable technology. Two-photon lithography enables the creation of complex nanoscale structures with high throughput, and 3D-printed SubMiniature version A connectors meet strict size constraints and deliver good radio-frequency performance. Additionally, 3D-printed supercapacitor electrodes optimize device performance and provide an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional production methods.
