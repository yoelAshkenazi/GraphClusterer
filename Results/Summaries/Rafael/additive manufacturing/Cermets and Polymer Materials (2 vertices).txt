Cermets and polymer-based materials are two distinct categories of materials explored for their potential in additive manufacturing processes. Researchers have focused on utilizing techniques such as selective laser sintering/melting, laser engineering net shaping, and various 3D printing methods to fabricate bulk cermet components, offering advantages over conventional production methods and allowing for the creation of complex cermet parts with enhanced properties. Polymers are widely used in additive manufacturing to manufacture components for various industries, including biomedical, automotive, and aerospace, employing techniques like stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused filament fabrication, fused deposition modeling, and binder jetting to create polymeric composite structures. These methods offer advantages such as cost-effectiveness and high accuracy, and have potential applications and future trends, highlighting the need for developing high-performance printable polymer composites to overcome the mechanical limitations of monolithic polymers.
