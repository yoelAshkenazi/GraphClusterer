Additive manufacturing (AM) and its applications in different industries are explored, introducing the concept of Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0, which integrates Industry 4.0 and sustainability, aiming to balance economic competitiveness and environmental concerns. The potential of AM in this context is highlighted, but challenges in implementing it as a sustainable manufacturing method are also acknowledged. Ceramic samples fabricated using traditional and additive technologies are compared in terms of accuracy, surface roughness, and porosity, suggesting that additive technology, particularly stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing, offers a promising approach for precision fabrication of ceramic parts with high quality. Metal AM processes, specifically beam-based technologies like selective laser sintering (SLM) and electron beam melting (EBM), and their limitations in terms of production cost, residual stress, and anisotropic mechanical properties are discussed, introducing beamless metal AM techniques as a potential solution. A study on the use of additive technologies to create formwork elements for complex walls in construction proposes a carbon fiber composite formwork manufactured using AM, which has shown sufficient strength and deformation resistance in laboratory tests. Selective laser melting (SLM) is highlighted as a promising method for producing metallic 3D objects with complex geometries, demonstrating an improved SLM process.
