Additive manufacturing (AM) has potential and challenges in various fields, particularly in its integration with other technologies and its role in sustainable development. The definition and classification of additive technologies are explored, as well as their application in industries such as construction, biomedical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0 combines Industry 4.0 with sustainability principles, and AM can produce better-performance products with less waste, but unresolved issues remain regarding its implementation. In construction, 3D printing creates unique structural elements and architectural features, with a focus on developing concrete mixtures. In biomedical engineering, AM creates biodegradable metals for bone substitution, and topologically ordered porous zinc scaffolds have potential for bone regeneration. In mechanical engineering, AM produces complex parts from various materials, improving surface quality and reducing production costs. Selective laser melting improves the surface quality of Inconel 718 alloy, and multifunctional porous nitinol is being developed for orthopedic implants, demonstrating enhanced properties.
