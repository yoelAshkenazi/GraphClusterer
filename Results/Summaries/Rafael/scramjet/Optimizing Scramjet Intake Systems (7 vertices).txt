Scramjet technology is a type of air-breathing engine designed for hypersonic flight with Mach numbers greater than 5 or 6. It utilizes supersonic combustion and shock wave compression to achieve efficient performance at high speeds. However, challenges exist in modeling and optimizing the scramjet's complex flow dynamics, combustion processes, and thermal management. A novel scramjet intake system with optimized fin angles and entrance width improves shock wave interactions and combustion efficiency, addressing pressure losses. Computer simulations are used to develop a scramjet mathematical model, involving 3D modeling of components and consideration of physicochemical processes in the combustor cooling system. Modifying the leading edge of the ramp improves scramjet intake models, demonstrating increased total pressure recovery and Mach number at the isolator exit. A new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations addresses the complex chemistry and flow physics of supersonic combustion, using a hybrid approach to accurately capture the effects of composition fluctuations.
