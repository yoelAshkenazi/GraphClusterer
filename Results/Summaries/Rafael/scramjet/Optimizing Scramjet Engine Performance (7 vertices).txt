Scramjet engines are a type of air-breathing engine designed for hypersonic flight with Mach numbers greater than 5 or 6. The design and flow conditions of scramjets present several challenges, emphasizing the importance of computational fluid dynamics in studying their complex flow structure. The fundamentals of turbulent supersonic combustion include the physics, governing equations, and kinetic schemes, with a focus on resolving closure problems for reaction rates and turbulence-chemistry interactions. A novel design for a scramjet intake system optimizes shock wave interactions, enhances combustion, and reduces pressure losses by varying fin angles and entrance width. A computational approach to developing a scramjet mathematical model starts with 3D models of individual components and reduces them to 1D models for performance optimization, allowing for faster calculations while maintaining accuracy. Modifying the leading edge of the ramp can reduce flow separation and improve pressure recovery, enhancing scramjet intake performance. A new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations accounts for composition fluctuations and uses a hybrid model closure with a reaction-rate approach, capturing the effects of composition fluctuations, especially near the fuel injector.
