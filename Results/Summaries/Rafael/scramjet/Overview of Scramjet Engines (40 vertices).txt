A comprehensive overview of scramjet engines, which are high-speed air-breathing propulsion systems, covers a wide range of topics, including historical development, computational and experimental methods for analyzing performance, and advanced techniques such as deep learning and laser-induced plasma ignition. Accurate modeling and simulation are crucial in scramjet design due to the complex interaction of aerodynamics and chemical kinetics. Various approaches to studying scramjet combustion include two-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional models, experimental investigations using different fuels and combustion chamber designs, and computational models using Navier-Stokes equations, energy conservation, and diffusion equations, along with chemical kinetic equations. These models predict spectral optical properties, thermal radiation, and radiative heat flux density. Deep learning is applied to velocity field prediction in a scramjet isolator using convolutional neural networks and pressure measurements, successfully learning the relationship between velocity field and wall pressure for accurate reconstruction.
