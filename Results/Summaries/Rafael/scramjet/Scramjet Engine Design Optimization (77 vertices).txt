The scramjet, an advanced air-breathing engine, is designed for hypersonic flight with Mach numbers greater than 5 or 6. Various aspects of its design, modeling, and performance enhancement are discussed, including the physics of combustion in supersonic flows, emphasizing the importance of understanding and predicting flow structures for efficient and stable combustion. This involves Navier-Stokes equations, kinetic schemes, and turbulence-chemistry interactions. A novel scramjet intake system design aims to improve shock wave interactions and combustion efficiency while reducing pressure losses through variations in fin angles and entrance width. A step-by-step computer simulation approach is proposed for creating a scramjet mathematical model, involving 3D and 1D models of various components, with a focus on physicochemical processes in the combustor cooling system. A numerical study explores the impact of a blunt leading edge on a scramjet intake model, showing improvements in pressure recovery and Mach number at the isolator exit. Computational challenges of modeling supersonic combustion are also covered, with a new subgrid combustion model proposed for large eddy simulations, using a hybrid model closure with the reaction-rate approach, which accounts for composition fluctuations and is tested on a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor. The role of fuel injection and mixing in the scramjet engine's performance is also examined.
