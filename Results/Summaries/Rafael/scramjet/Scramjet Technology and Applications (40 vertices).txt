Scramjet technology and its applications in high-speed flight involve various aspects, including the development and testing of scramjet engines through experimental models, computational simulations, and flight tests. Understanding complex phenomena within scramjet combustors, such as combustion processes, ignition, and flame stabilization, is a key focus. Three-dimensional computer models are crucial in scramjet development for accurate parameter prediction of flow fields, and a data-driven approach using convolutional neural networks can predict velocity fields in a scramjet isolator based on wall pressure measurements. The historical development of scramjet propulsion emphasizes the importance of experimental data from various countries, providing a comprehensive review of model experiments, including inlet-isolator, combustor designs, and fuel injection methods. Thermodynamic analysis of scramjet systems compares conventional designs with alternative schemes incorporating magnetohydrodynamic devices, demonstrating potential advantages in meeting engineering constraints and improving overall performance under various flight conditions.
