Scramjet technology, a type of air-breathing propulsion system designed for hypersonic flight, is explored through various aspects, including experimental investigations, computational modeling, thermodynamic analysis, and engine development for hypersonic aircraft. On-ground testing of a scramjet unit focuses on flight regimes and utilizes a piston gasdynamic unit for complex investigation. Fields of concentrations, pressure, and temperature in a scramjet combustor are calculated, considering different fuels and chemical kinetics models. Proper geometry and flame stabilization in solid fuel scramjets are crucial, with a computational model aiming to account for geometry variation. A historical overview of scramjet development emphasizes the importance of three-dimensional computer models. A new approach for velocity field prediction in a scramjet isolator uses convolutional neural networks and numerical simulations. Modern development projects for high-speed vehicles with scramjet power plants are reviewed, analyzing challenges and solutions. A joint Russian-American project conducts a flight test of a dual-mode scramjet, aiming for flight-to-ground correlation of measured data, while a scramjet design undergoes flow path performance and thermal evaluation.
