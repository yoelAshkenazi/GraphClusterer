Scramjet engines, a type of air-breathing propulsion system used in hypersonic vehicles, require efficient fuel-air mixing within the combustor to maintain stable combustion and maximize engine performance. Several strategies for enhancing fuel-air mixing are discussed, including cavity flame holders, dual-mode combustors, and various injection techniques such as transverse injection, strut injection, and multi-extruded nozzles. Geometric parameters, fuel distribution, and injection strategies impact combustion performance. Computational fluid dynamics and numerical simulations are essential for studying scramjet combustion, analyzing shock wave interactions, fuel penetration, mixing efficiency, and design parameters' influence on engine performance. Challenges associated with scramjet engine technology include thermal management, ignition, and flame stabilization. Hydrogen is discussed as a fuel, highlighting its advantages and disadvantages. Regenerative cooling and multi-stage open cooling cycles are proposed for thermal management. Different injection techniques affect the flow field, shock wave patterns, and mixing efficiency, with fuel injection pressure, jet space, and annular nozzles playing a role. Shock generators can improve fuel mixing.
