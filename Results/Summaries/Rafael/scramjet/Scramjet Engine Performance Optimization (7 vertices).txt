Scramjet engines, designed for hypersonic flight with Mach numbers greater than 5 or 6, are characterized by their strong coupling of elements, including supersonic core, subsonic zones, and high losses caused by shock waves, viscous effects, dissociation, and radiation. Various aspects of scramjet engine design and performance are explored, including the use of shock waves for compression, novel intake system designs, computer simulations for model development, and the impact of leading edge blunt on intake performance. A new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations is developed, introducing a hybrid approach to close the filtered chemical source terms in the governing equations, considering the effect of composition fluctuations. The model is tested using a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor and compared to simulations with quasi-laminar chemistry or PSR approach, highlighting the significance of composition fluctuations. The role of fuel injection and mixing in the scramjet engine's performance is also investigated, including the impact of strut fin placement within the nozzle injector on fuel distribution and penetration, finding that the inner fin improves fuel mixing when the vortex strength is not too high, and the 3-lobe injector has higher efficiency compared to other nozzle types.
