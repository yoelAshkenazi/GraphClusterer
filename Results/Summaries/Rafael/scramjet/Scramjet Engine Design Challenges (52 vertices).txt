Scramjet engines pose various design challenges, including combustion processes, and utilize cavities for flame stabilization and mixing enhancement. Efficient fuel-air mixing is crucial, and cavities play a significant role in achieving this, with various mixing augmentation devices and injection strategies discussed. Cavity shape, location, and dual/double cavity configurations impact scramjet performance, with the cavity rear wall-expansion identified as a promising approach. Hydrogen fuel, multi-stage open cooling cycles, and optimized fuel injection strategies are also being developed. The dual-mode scramjet combustor is a key area of focus, with flame propagation, stabilization, and operational conditions and geometric parameters being studied. Strut injection, cavities, and transverse injection techniques are being examined, with the latter showing promise for improving fuel-air mixing. Shock waves, regenerative cooling technologies, and hydrogen fuel storage are also being researched. Multi-extruded nozzles and inner air jets can enhance fuel mixing and distribution. Computational fluid dynamics and numerical simulations are essential for understanding and optimizing scramjet performance, and further research is needed in this area.
