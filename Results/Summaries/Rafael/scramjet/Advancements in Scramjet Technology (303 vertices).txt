The development of scramjet technology has been a significant focus in the field of hypersonic flight, with various research institutions and organizations contributing to its advancement. A comprehensive overview of the current state of scramjet technology covers various aspects such as experimental investigations, computational modeling, and the challenges associated with its development. Developing three-dimensional computer models for scramjet processes is important, and a review of the experimental database developed by various countries highlights the key components of scramjet technology, such as inlet-isolators, combustors, and fuel injectors, emphasizing the importance of model experiments for validating computer codes and kinetic models. Thermodynamic analysis of scramjet engines includes comparative studies of various schemes and the advantages of subsonic mode operation. The use of magnetohydrodynamic devices in the propulsion system flow train is explored, with a modified AJAX concept proposed to address engineering limitations. Studies also focus on the ignition and combustion of different fuel blends in scramjet ducts, the influence of energy sources on hypersonic aircraft, and the development of efficient flame stabilization techniques for supersonic combustors. Struts serve as fuel injectors and flame holders, impacting mixing, thermal protection, and combustion stabilization mechanisms.
