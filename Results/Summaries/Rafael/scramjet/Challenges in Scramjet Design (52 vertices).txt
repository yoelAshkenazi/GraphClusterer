The design of scramjet engines presents several challenges, particularly in achieving efficient fuel-air mixing within the short residence time of the fuel in the combustor. Various injection strategies, such as wall injection, struts, ramps, cavities, vortex generators, and new configurations developed in China, have been proposed and investigated to address this issue. Cavity flame holders are a well-organized method for supporting the ignition zone in scramjet engines. The influence of cavity design on scramjet combustor performance is analyzed from three aspects: variation of shape/geometry, location of fuel/air injection, and recent progress in dual/double cavities. The significance of cavity rear wall-expansion in enhancing the efficiency of scramjet combustors is highlighted, while the presence of micro air jets improves the flame holding mechanism. Additionally, dual cavities significantly improve scramjet performance, making them a feasible choice for future scramjet engine development. The main challenges and configurations for achieving scramjet engines include non-dimensional parameters, main parts and their roles, and required fuel types for different flight ranges. Thermal management of scramjet engines is a critical issue, and a competent cooling system is essential to recover waste energy, with the multi-stage open cooling cycle proposed as an appropriate choice.
