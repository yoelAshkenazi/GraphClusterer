Various applications and advancements in drone technology are discussed, focusing on autonomous systems and their potential benefits in different fields. SwarmGear, a novel concept for autonomous inspection using a heterogeneous swarm of drones with a leader-follower formation, addresses power supply and uneven surface challenges. A similar concept, SwarmHive, enables dynamic landing on a moving robot, utilizing a single camera on the leader drone and artificial potential fields for collision-free trajectories. Autonomous UAV movement is achieved using a Raspberry Pi 4 and PX4 flight controller with a Linux system and Python programming. The Internet of Autonomous Things (IoAT) has applications in healthcare, military, transportation, and home robotics, with a focus on deep learning and AI. A vision-based drone swarm docking system, SwarmHawk, enables robust landing on a moving platform using RGB cameras and QR-code markers for tracking and navigation. A compact LIDAR instrument is developed for fluorescence spectroscopy sensing of maize fields, enabling autonomous detection of stressed plants. Real-time onboard object tracking for drones is achieved using multi-inertial sensing data with a lightweight algorithm and efficient hardware. WareVR, a VR-based human-robot interface, allows warehouse workers to control a heterogeneous robotic system remotely for inventory management.
