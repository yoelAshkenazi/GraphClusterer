Drones are being developed for navigation and collision avoidance in complex environments, such as forests, using artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques, which is crucial for tasks like research and rescue operations. Swarm drone collaboration, where multiple drones work together, emphasizes energy efficiency, data sharing, and security. In logistics, drones can work with delivery trucks, optimizing routes and synchronizing deliveries, and can also be used for monitoring and detection, as demonstrated in an oil slick detection system using optical sensing and AI. Drones assist in crop monitoring, irrigation, and spraying in agriculture, offering precision and efficiency. The technical aspects of drone technology include network architectures, training methods, and hardware considerations, and drones have the potential to optimize processes and improve efficiency in industries like agriculture, logistics, and environmental monitoring.
