Drone technology, its applications, and challenges are explored through various aspects. Deep reinforcement learning's potential in autonomous drone control is discussed, specifically for industrial applications such as inspection and search and rescue operations, highlighting the algorithm's ability to find target paths autonomously. Drone swarms are emphasized for their advantages over single drones in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially in harsh environments, with a swarm intelligence-based robust solution leveraging consensus methods and grey prediction to enhance robustness against node failures. Decentralized flocking approaches for drone swarms are proposed, enabling collective motion in three dimensions, adapting to the environment by maintaining a preferred distance from the ground and adjusting formations. Autonomous UAVs for environmental monitoring are discussed, detailing power supply, navigation, and data encryption considerations, introducing a six-engine drone equipped with an ultra-wideband radar. A flexible, fully printed IoT antenna for drone-deployed sensor units is introduced, optimized for IoT applications, emphasizing the potential for improved performance in drone-based sensing applications. Two deep learning approaches are compared.
