Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, also known as drones, has various applications in different fields. Robot navigation is one aspect, with a robotic operating system utilizing SLAM and navigation algorithms for efficient indoor and outdoor mapping. Energy efficiency in drone swarms is explored, with a load-balancing mechanism proposed to optimize flight distance in a V-shaped formation. A strategy for extending UAV flight duration involves placing them on stationary objects to reduce power consumption during customer service operations. Heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air vehicles are compared for surveillance applications, with solutions proposed to improve their effectiveness. Drones offer benefits in Emergency Medical Services systems, with a bi-objective mathematical model maximizing patient survival while minimizing CO2 emissions. Routing protocols for Flying Ad Hoc Networks are also explored, with reinforcement learning-based methods improving communication between drones. Drag reduction in drone swarms is investigated, with a replacement algorithm proposed to optimize energy consumption during flight, leading to improved performance and flight duration.
