Drone technology has various applications and advancements, including detecting faults in railway track fasteners using deep learning and autonomous drones, which achieves high accuracy in identifying missing or faulty fasteners. A hybrid algorithm combining potential field and curl-free vector field methods is proposed to prevent jamming in drone swarms for obstacle avoidance. Drones are used in indoor positioning and navigation without GPS, utilizing deep network-based systems and photogrammetry to achieve precise positioning. They are also utilized in a proposed architecture for radio access networks, acting as relay points between base stations and users, with a particle swarm optimization algorithm optimizing their deployment. Security is addressed with a blockchain-based solution for data assurance and resilience in drone communication and a solution to intercept attacking drones by modeling them as an oscillatory system with antagonistic components. A design for a low-cost, open-source thruster using drone motors and a surveillance drone system for secure cash/valuable transport are also presented.
