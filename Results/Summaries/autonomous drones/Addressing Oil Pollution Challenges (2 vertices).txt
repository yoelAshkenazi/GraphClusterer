An innovative approach to addressing the growing issue of oil pollution in marine environments, particularly in localized areas, involves a monitoring system that utilizes drones, optical sensing, and artificial intelligence to detect and classify oil slicks on the sea surface. The system is comprised of three separate Hard and Soft Frameworks that work together to monitor and identify oil pollution, employing computer vision and AI for detection and classification, laser-induced fluorescence to identify oil products and measure their concentration, and autonomous drone navigation and control. This technology has the potential to tackle oil pollution challenges. Meanwhile, the development of artificial intelligence raises legal and criminal policy implications, including the potential for various types of crimes such as phishing, drone misuse, and the creation of fake information, and challenges in determining criminal liability when AI systems act autonomously without direct human control, suggesting a need to revisit the legal concept of "innocent harm" and adapt legal systems to the unique challenges posed by AI-related crimes through a new type of legal framework that moves from "law as a text" to "law as a code" implemented through technological platforms.
