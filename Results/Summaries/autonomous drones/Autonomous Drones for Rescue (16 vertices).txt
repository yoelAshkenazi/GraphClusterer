A unique autonomous robotic platform for rescue missions operates without a LIDAR system and relies on ultrasonic and optical sensors. The increasing interest in drones for delivery and monitoring is driven by technological breakthroughs and environmental concerns, highlighting the importance of hybrid power supply systems and energy management for optimizing drone performance. Various drone applications include a jamming-assisted navigation system, JAM-ME, to overcome anti-drone measures, and drone swarming for urban surveillance, utilizing 3D visualization and secure context information sharing. A fluorescence LIDAR system for remote sensing of vegetation and early crop disease detection is also presented, along with a system for aggressive flight of autonomous quadrotors, ensuring smooth and safe trajectories. Open-source tools and software for UAVs offer benefits and applications, and a real-time surveillance strategy for detecting abnormal behaviors in crowds uses deep transfer learning and the Internet of Drones. A hybrid truck-drone parcel delivery system addresses payload and battery capacity limitations, and a portable drone design for educational purposes and a swarm intelligence algorithm for optimal drone placement are also proposed.
