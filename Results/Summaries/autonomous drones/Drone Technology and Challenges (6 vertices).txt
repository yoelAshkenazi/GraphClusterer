Drone technology has various aspects, applications, and challenges. Autonomous drone operation in unknown environments is a need, and a positioning system using monocular SLAM and IMU shows promising results for long-distance flights. Safety assurance for drones is crucial, especially in the Internet of Drones context, and qualitative and quantitative safety analysis approaches can address potential risks. Anti-drone systems are necessary to protect against security and privacy threats, and an anti-drone system, ADS-ZJU, combines multiple surveillance technologies. A monocular vision-based system enables autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance in commercial drones using SLAM and sensor fusion techniques. The growing civilian drone market raises privacy and security concerns, requiring efficient and accurate drone detection systems, and various techniques exist with trade-offs between performance metrics. An acoustic-based surveillance system can detect and localize amateur drone misuse 24/7, as demonstrated through field experiments. Overall, autonomous navigation, safety assurance, anti-drone measures, and detection systems are crucial topics in the rapidly growing drone technology field.
