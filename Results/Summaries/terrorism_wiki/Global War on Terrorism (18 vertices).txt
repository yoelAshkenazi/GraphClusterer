Global political and military tensions are fueled by Islamist militant groups and counterterrorism operations. The Algerian Civil War saw the rise of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, which merged with al-Qaeda to form al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. This group, along with other Islamist insurgents in the Maghreb and Sahel regions, has been targeted by counterterrorism operations, including Operation Enduring Freedom â€“ Trans Sahara and the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership. Ongoing conflicts in Yemen, the Sahel, and Somalia contribute to regional instability, with multiple factions vying for power in Yemen and spillover effects from the Mali War in the Sahel. The Somali Civil War, rooted in resistance to a military junta in the 1980s, continues to this day. Historical events, such as the Norman Conquest of England and territorial disputes between Ethiopia and Somalia dating back to the 1300s, have shaped regional histories. The Global War on Terrorism, initiated after the September 11 attacks, has targeted militant Islamist movements across multiple regions, leading to significant events such as the 2021 Taliban offensive in Afghanistan and interventions against the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria, and Libya.
