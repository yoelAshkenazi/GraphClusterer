Belligerent refers to an entity engaging in hostile actions. The Geneva Conventions are international humanitarian laws that establish standards for humanitarian treatment during war, with specific protections for civilians and medical personnel. The Allies, led by major powers like the UK, France, and the US, fought against the Central Powers in World War I and the Axis powers in World War II. Operation Overlord, including the Normandy landings, was a significant Allied operation during World War II, leading to the liberation of Western Europe from German occupation. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, founded on principles of neutrality and humanity, plays a crucial role in protecting human life and health during conflicts. The organization's emblems are protected under the Geneva Conventions, ensuring the safety of medical and humanitarian personnel in warzones. Distinguishing between combatants and civilians, the role of neutral countries, and the work of non-governmental organizations in providing aid and promoting humanitarian norms are also important. The concept of primary care in healthcare and the use of protective signs during armed conflicts are also notable.
