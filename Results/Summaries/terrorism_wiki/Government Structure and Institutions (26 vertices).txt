The judiciary, an essential component, interprets and applies the law, resolving disputes through a system of courts, and is part of a broader government structure that includes the executive and legislative branches. Government agencies, distinct from departments or ministries, manage specific functions, such as the Department of the Interior, responsible for federal lands and natural resources, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which governs government procurement. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress power over federal lands and establishes the structure of the federal government, including the executive branch, which enforces laws, and the legislature, responsible for creating and amending laws. At the state level, Washington's government has a bicameral legislature with a House of Representatives and a Senate, both without term limits, and the Washington Supreme Court is part of the judiciary. Institutions, which are human-devised rules and norms shaping social behavior, and ideologies play a role in shaping political systems, as seen in the space-grant colleges and the New York City Board of Aldermen.
