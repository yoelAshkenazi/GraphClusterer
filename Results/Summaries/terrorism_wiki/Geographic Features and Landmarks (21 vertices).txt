The United States and Canada are home to a diverse range of geographical features, with a particular focus on New York City and its surrounding areas. The Harlem River, a tidal strait, separates Manhattan from the Bronx, and its northern stretch, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, has been modified for navigation. Eastchester Bay, a sound between City Island and the Bronx, and the Bronx Kill, a narrow strait separating the Bronx from Randalls Island, are also notable. The Olympic Mountains in the Pacific Northwest and the Fox River in Wisconsin contribute to the region's geography. A sound is a smaller body of water connected to a sea or ocean, and examples include Eastchester Bay and Flushing Bay. Islands in the region include Liberty Island, home to the iconic Statue of Liberty, as well as Randalls and Wards Island in New York City, and Roosevelt Island in the East River. Rivers, such as the Bronx River and the Fox River, play a significant role in the area's drainage systems. The East River, a saltwater tidal estuary, separates Manhattan from Long Island and the Bronx, showcasing the city's unique geography. Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, stands as one of the oldest public farmers' markets in the United States, offering a historical and cultural connection to the region's agricultural heritage.
