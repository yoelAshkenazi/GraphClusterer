The Early Dynastic period in Mesopotamia was characterized by the emergence of city-states and the development of writing. The Throgs Neck Bridge in New York City is a significant infrastructure project. Ireland's geography, population, and capital city, Dublin, are notable, as is the concept of islands and their formation. Mesopotamia, a historical region in West Asia, was the site of ancient Sumerian civilization and the development of writing. Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, has ancient origins, and the Sumerian language is an ancient isolate spoken in Mesopotamia. Lebanon's political status and capital, Beirut, are also relevant. Ernest Choquin de Sarzec, a French archaeologist, discovered ancient Sumer, and Patricia Murray is an American politician. The Cook Islands and Niue are associated with New Zealand, and Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States. Glacial lakes and the Gaza Strip, a densely populated Palestinian territory, are also notable. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, and Lagash, an ancient city-state, are significant in the context of ancient history and early civilizations in Mesopotamia.
