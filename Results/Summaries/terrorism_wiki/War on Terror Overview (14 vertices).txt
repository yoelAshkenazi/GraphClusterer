Various conflicts and military operations across Africa and the Middle East are interconnected by the broader War on Terror. The Algerian Civil War saw the rise of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, an Algerian militant group that later became affiliated with al-Qaeda. This led to the establishment of Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara, a U.S.-led counterterrorism effort in the Sahel and Saharan regions, with the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership as its military component. The War on Terror also encompasses the Somali Civil War, the Yemeni Civil War, and the Ethiopian-Somali conflict, all of which involve Islamist insurgencies and territorial disputes. The Global War on Terrorism targets militant Islamist movements, including al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and has resulted in various operations like Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa, with the Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa and multinational naval forces as key components. The 2021 Taliban offensive in Afghanistan and the Islamic State's activities in Syria and Iraq further highlight the complexity of the War on Terror, with many states intervening to combat these extremist groups.
