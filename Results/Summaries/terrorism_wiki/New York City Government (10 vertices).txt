New York City's government is structured with a mayor-council system, headed by an elected mayor who serves a four-year term. The city is divided into five boroughs—the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island—each coextensive with a respective county of New York State. These boroughs represent the major governmental districts, and within them, community boards advise on various matters such as land use and service delivery. The lieutenant governor, the second-highest-ranking official in the state, is also elected for a four-year term. New York's architectural landscape includes Art Deco buildings from the 1920s and 1930s, found across all five boroughs. This style is known for its vertical emphasis and use of modern materials. The National Park Service manages national parks and monuments across the country, operating under the U.S. Department of the Interior, led by the Secretary of the Interior, who oversees the conservation and management of federal lands and natural resources.
