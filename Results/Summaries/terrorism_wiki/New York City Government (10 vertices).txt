New York City, a bustling metropolis, operates under a mayor-council system, with an elected mayor at its helm for a four-year term. The city is divided into five distinct boroughs: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island, each mirroring a county of New York State. These boroughs are further subdivided into community districts, each with its own advisory community board, offering insights on local issues like land use and service delivery. The lieutenant governor, elected alongside the governor, holds the second-highest office in New York State. The National Park Service, established in 1916, oversees the management of national parks, monuments, and various historical and recreational sites across the country, led by the Secretary of the Interior, who plays a pivotal role in managing and conserving federal lands and natural resources. New York City boasts a rich architectural heritage, including the Art Deco style that flourished in the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by its verticality and unique materials, and can be admired in government buildings, commercial projects, and residential structures across the city's five boroughs.
