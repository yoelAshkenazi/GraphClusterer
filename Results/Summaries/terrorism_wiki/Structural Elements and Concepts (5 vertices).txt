Load-bearing walls are a fundamental structural element, supporting the weight of a building and transferring it to the foundation. This concept has been utilized in early construction and evolved with the introduction of flying buttresses in Gothic architecture. In contrast, curtain walls are non-structural exterior coverings, providing protection from the elements while allowing for open interior spaces. A home is defined as a space for human residence, offering both shelter and areas for various domestic activities. The concept of a setback refers to a step-like wall design that improves a building's stability by lowering its center of mass. Finally, thrust vectoring is a technique used in aircraft and rockets to control the vehicle's attitude by manipulating engine thrust, a method that became essential for attitude control in space travel.
