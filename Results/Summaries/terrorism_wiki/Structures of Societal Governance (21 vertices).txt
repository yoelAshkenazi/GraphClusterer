The legal system plays a crucial role in governing societies, with case law, also known as common law, forming the foundation of this system. It is a precedent-based approach, relying on past judicial decisions to guide future legal outcomes. Jurisdiction is a key concept, defining the legal authority granted to entities to administer justice, which can vary across federal levels. The judiciary, a vital component of the legal system, interprets and applies the law, ensuring the resolution of legal disputes. Government comprises the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, each with distinct roles. The executive branch wields significant influence over national politics, but is subject to limitations. Architectural movements, such as Modernism, Postmodernism, and Neo-futurism, offer diverse approaches to design and functionality, with the International Style emphasizing functionality and minimalism. Institutions shape and constrain social behavior through rules, norms, and persistence, contributing to the overall legal system.
