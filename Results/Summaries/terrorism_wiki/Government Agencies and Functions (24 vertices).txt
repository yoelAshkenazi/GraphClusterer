A government agency is a permanent or semi-permanent organization responsible for the oversight and administration of specific functions. The Federal Acquisition Regulation is the principal set of rules regarding government procurement in the United States. The Department of Transportation in New York City manages much of the city's transportation infrastructure, has a training center in eastern Queens, and is headed by a commissioner appointed by the mayor. The Virginia Department of Transportation is responsible for transportation in Virginia, including building, maintaining, and operating roads, bridges, and tunnels. Legislative bodies, such as the New York State Assembly, the Washington State Legislature, and the Michigan Legislature, enact and amend laws, with specific structures and functions, and varying levels of authority and representation. The Washington Supreme Court is the highest court in the state of Washington, composed of a chief justice and eight associate justices, all elected to six-year terms. Public universities receive significant funding from the government, and federal lands are managed and conserved by the United States Department of the Interior. Other government-related topics include the power to make laws, engineering, the Federal Highway Administration, and the space-grant colleges network for space-related research. Governmental structures, agencies, and their roles vary significantly across different states, each with unique responsibilities and functions.
