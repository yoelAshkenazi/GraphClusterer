A range of business-related topics are covered, primarily focusing on various forms of company structures and ownership models. Real estate development involves the renovation and sale of properties, with developers coordinating these activities. Public companies have an ownership structure through freely traded shares on stock exchanges, facilitating liquidity and transparency. Privately held companies have private ownership and trading of shares, often referred to as "over-the-counter" trading. The largest privately held companies by revenue exclude state-owned enterprises. Equity sharing, or shared ownership, is a strategy to maximize profits and tax deductions in real estate, where multiple owners invest in a property and later divide the profits. Joint ventures are formed by multiple parties to access new markets, gain efficiencies, share risks, or access skills. Over-the-counter trading is a direct transaction between two parties without exchange supervision, lacking the transparency and liquidity benefits of stock exchanges. Business divisions are distinct parts of a company that are legally interconnected. The nature of trust in business relationships emphasizes the trustor's vulnerability and lack of control over the trustee's actions.
