A powered lift aircraft, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, combines the vertical takeoff and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and performance of a fixed-wing aircraft through the use of tiltrotor or tiltwing designs, where the rotors or wings can rotate, enabling both vertical and horizontal flight. These aircraft are classified as convertiplanes, capable of transitioning between different modes of flight. Different types of aircraft include fixed-wing airplanes, helicopters, and rotary-wing aircraft, each with distinct characteristics, such as helicopters using spinning rotors to generate lift and enable vertical takeoff and landing, while fixed-wing aircraft rely on aerodynamic lift. The concept of lift is a crucial force in flight, acting perpendicular to the flow direction and countering gravity. The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an example of modern engineering, designed for military transport and cargo, combining helicopter-like capabilities with the efficiency of a turboprop aircraft.
