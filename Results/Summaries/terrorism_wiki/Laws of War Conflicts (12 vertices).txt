The concept of belligerency is a critical element of the laws of war, which outline the rules and principles governing armed conflicts. The Allies, including the UK, France, and the US, launched Operation Overlord, a major military operation against German-occupied France, as part of a broader global conflict between the Allies and the Axis powers. This conflict saw the use of advanced weaponry like tanks and aircraft, as well as the introduction of nuclear weapons. The laws of war provide specific legal protections for 'protected persons' during armed conflicts, and one of its key principles is 'distinction', which requires the differentiation between combatants and protected civilians. The Allies, or the Entente, formed a coalition against the Central Powers in World War I, and this war, along with World War II, highlighted the complexities of international relations and the legal frameworks that attempt to regulate them. Vichy France, established after France's defeat and capitulation to Germany, was a significant political entity during World War II, named after its seat of government in the city of Vichy.
