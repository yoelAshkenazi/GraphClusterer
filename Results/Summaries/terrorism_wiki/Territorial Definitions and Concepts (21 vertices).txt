A territory is defined as an area belonging to a particular entity, and in international politics, it often refers to a region without self-governance. Structures are built entities, including buildings and non-building structures, with the latter not designed for continuous human occupancy. Various regions like West Africa, Quintana Roo in Mexico, and the Western Hemisphere, which includes the Americas, are notable. Real estate development involves the conversion of ideas into tangible property, including buildings and other structures. The Atlantic Ocean is a significant geographical feature, noted for its historical role in separating the New World from the Old World. The United States of America, Mexico, and other North American countries have territories, numbering plans, and cultural sites. International zones are areas with unique administrative and visa policies, separate from the surrounding state. Territorial definitions, architectural concepts, and geopolitical landscapes are particularly emphasized in North America and its various regions.
