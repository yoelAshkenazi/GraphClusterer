World War II was a global conflict between the Allies and the Axis powers, lasting from 1939 to 1945, involving nearly all of the world's countries, with nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war, marked by the use of tanks and aircraft, and the strategic bombing of cities, including the first and only use of nuclear weapons in warfare, with the United States dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, leading to Japan's surrender. The criteria for ongoing armed conflicts emphasise the involvement of organised armed groups, governmental or non-governmental, in interstate, intrastate, and non-state contexts, with combatants being subject to attack due to their status, regardless of specific circumstances. Visual perception is explained as the ability to detect light and form images of the surrounding environment, involving photopic vision and scotopic vision in most vertebrates. The political relationship between an associated state and a larger state is discussed, with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV) Principle VI and the Compact of Free Association or Associated Statehood Act providing the framework for such relationships. The lack of a universally accepted definition for terrorism is highlighted, with various legal systems and government agencies using different definitions, and governments being reluctant to formulate a legally binding definition. Public companies are owned through shares of stock traded on stock exchanges or over-the-counter markets, and the history of Bloomberg Businessweek magazine and The Philadelphia Inquirer are covered. Geographical and architectural terms include the term 'crow's nest', a structure on ships used as a lookout point, and the concept of sovereign states is discussed, along with the criteria for recognising their sovereignty, and stateless persons, individuals not considered nationals by any state.
