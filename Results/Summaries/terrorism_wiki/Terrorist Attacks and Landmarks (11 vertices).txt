The World Trade Center, an iconic complex in New York City, stood as a symbol of American economic prowess with its completion in the 1970s. This symbol was shattered on September 11, 2001, when al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked commercial airliners and crashed them into the Twin Towers, resulting in their collapse and the loss of nearly 3,000 lives. The event also included an attack on the Pentagon, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in history. The World Trade Center site is being redeveloped with new skyscrapers, a memorial, and a museum, symbolizing resilience and remembrance. In 2002, a tragic event occurred at the El Ghriba synagogue in Tunisia, where a suicide bomber killed and injured numerous tourists and locals, demonstrating the global reach of terrorism. Blackstone Inc., a prominent investment management company, and the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography, which recognizes exceptional photography in journalism, represent significant entities in their respective fields.
