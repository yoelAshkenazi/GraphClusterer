Pakistan is home to a diverse range of natural and historical sites. The Mushkpuri mountain stands at 2,800 meters in the Nathia Gali Hills, while the Kaghan Valley stretches across the country with its highest peak, Malika Parbat, reaching 5,290 meters. Saiful Muluk, a high-altitude lake, is also located in this region. The country's largest offshore island, Astola Island, is designated as a wetland of international importance. The Swat Valley's Kalam area showcases the Swat River's formation. The Mahabat Khan Mosque, a 17th-century Mughal-era monument, and the Bab-e-Khyber, a famous post-independence structure at the Khyber Pass, are also notable. The 2023 Pakistan Census provides valuable demographic data. The United States conducted its 23rd census in 2010, utilizing mail-in citizen self-reporting and hiring temporary enumerators for accuracy. Charna Island, an uninhabited island in the Arabian Sea, and Virginia State Route 110, a highway in Arlington, Virginia, are also notable locations.
