A collection of iconic buildings and structures around the world, ranging from the Inland Steel Building in Chicago to the Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taiwan, showcases the evolution of architectural design and engineering, particularly in the realm of skyscrapers. These towering structures, including the Chrysler Building and the John Hancock Center in New York City, and the Willis Tower in Chicago, have shaped the skylines of major cities and pushed the boundaries of construction. The Inland Steel Building, designed by Bruce Graham and Walter Netsch, is a significant post-World War II commercial high-rise in Chicago. Graham also designed the John Hancock Center and the Willis Tower, the latter in collaboration with Fazlur Rahman Khan, a pioneer in structural engineering for skyscrapers. The Chrysler Building, an Art Deco masterpiece, was the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. The Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown and the New York Times Building in Manhattan, as well as international landmarks like 5 Canada Square in London's Canary Wharf, the Fagus Factory in Germany, and the Taipei 101, all contribute to the diverse architectural landscape. The history of tall buildings traces back to the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the 20th century saw the rise of skyscrapers, with various architectural styles, materials, and engineering innovations. These buildings, from the early steel-framed structures to modern supertall towers, reflect the ingenuity and creativity of their designers and engineers, who have left an indelible mark on the urban landscape.
