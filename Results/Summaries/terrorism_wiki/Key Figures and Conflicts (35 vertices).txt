The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War, which began on March 20, 2003, and lasted just over a month. It involved a United States-led coalition of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland invading the Republic of Iraq. The capital city of Baghdad was captured by coalition forces on April 9, 2003, after the six-day-long Battle of Baghdad. The invasion was followed by a series of conflicts, including the Iraq War (2003–2011), the Iraqi insurgency (2011–2013), the War in Iraq (2013–2017), and the Islamic State insurgency in Northern Iraq (2017–present). The Iraq War was preceded by the 2001 September 11 attacks, which led to the United States declaring a war on terror and subsequently leading a multinational military operation against Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden, the founder of Al-Qaeda, was a Saudi Arabian-born Islamist dissident and militant leader who participated in the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union and supported the Bosnian mujahideen during the Yugoslav Wars. Bin Laden was opposed to the United States' foreign policy in the Middle East and declared war on the U.S. in 1996, advocating attacks targeting U.S. military and economic interests. Al-Qaeda is a pan-Islamist militant organization led by Sunni jihadists who aim to unite the Muslim world under a supra-national Islamic caliphate. The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, with its epicenter near the town of Léogâne, approximately 25 kilometers west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.
