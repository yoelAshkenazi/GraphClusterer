3D printing technology has diverse applications and advancements across various fields, with a particular focus on construction, medicine, and mechanical engineering. In construction, 3D printing has revolutionized the way concrete structures are built, offering cost and time efficiency by eliminating the need for formwork, and its autonomous nature makes it feasible for constructing structures on Mars. The mechanical properties of 3D-printed objects are anisotropic, requiring specialized testing and analysis, and the impact of printing angles and material types on tensile strength is significant for optimizing 3D-printed parts. In medicine, 3D printing has shown promise in fracture treatment, with a process established for creating customized implants using X-ray and micro-CT images, providing a patient-specific solution. The use of 3D printing in creating concrete structures emphasizes the importance of reinforcement and the potential for individualized and digitalized designs, and the limitations and solutions for practical applications are addressed. The characterization of 3D-printed conductors' electrical properties and methods to enhance their performance are also introduced, proposing the use of infrared thermography and VCSEM to improve the design of 3D-printed transducers and exploit the electrical properties of 3D-printed conductors.
