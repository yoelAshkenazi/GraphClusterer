3D printing technology is revolutionizing various sectors, including scientific research, education, and healthcare. The NIH 3D Print Exchange is an online platform that provides researchers and educators with a valuable resource, ensuring accurate and informative models, aiming to bridge the gap in the availability of scientific 3D models and the expertise required to create them. Training and problem-solving skills are essential when implementing 3D printing services in academic libraries, as this technology has the potential to enhance learning experiences, but demands a certain level of expertise to create successful 3D objects. In healthcare, 3D printing is gaining traction, with efforts to document and categorize 3D printed medical models for better reimbursement, where proper documentation and the use of established codes are crucial for accurate medical billing and reimbursement. Maximizing the benefits of 3D printing technology requires careful consideration of factors such as cost, resolution, and material, especially in medical education and practice, and institutions must invest in the necessary infrastructure, documentation, and knowledge to fully utilize this technology's potential.
