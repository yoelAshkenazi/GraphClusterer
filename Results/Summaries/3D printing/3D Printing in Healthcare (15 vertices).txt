The increasing popularity of 3D printing technology in healthcare has led to its application in various medical fields, including orthoses, radiology, forensic science, cardiovascular medicine, and surgical planning. This technology offers numerous advantages, such as improved biomechanical and kinematic parameters, high satisfaction and comfort, and the ability to provide information that traditional visualization tools cannot. 3D printing is particularly useful in the medical domain, as it allows for the creation of personalized models and implantable materials, as well as the simulation of surgical environments for preoperative training and patient education. However, there are challenges to its widespread adoption, such as the need for specialized skills in 3D design and modeling, the complexity of 3D printing manufacturing, and the lack of regulation and quality control. To address these challenges, a review of logistic considerations for establishing a clinical service using this technology has been provided, including printer and software selection, model creation, and research directions. A 3D printing registry has been established to collect data on the use of 3D printing in medicine, which will support future reimbursement efforts. 3D printing has been used to create anatomically accurate skull replicas for forensic facial reconstruction, patient-specific 3D models for surgical planning in mitral valve disease and atrial septal defect, and customized 3D-printed implants for fracture healing. The technology has also been applied in the simulation of surgical environments for preoperative training and patient education, with the potential to replace animal carcasses with 3D-printed organ models. Furthermore, 3D printing has been used in the creation of customized operation tools, artificial bones or teeth for implantation, and even organs, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes and the efficiency of medical procedures. However, the technology is still in its early stages, and further research and development are needed to fully realize its potential in healthcare.
