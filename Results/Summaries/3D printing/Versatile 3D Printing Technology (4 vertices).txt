3D printing is a highly versatile technology with applications spanning various fields, from rapid prototyping to biomedical engineering. This technology enables the creation of customized and functional objects through the use of diverse materials and techniques. The ability to manipulate structures significantly enhances mass and heat transfer during the adsorption process. Methods can be categorized based on the type of adsorption material used. The environmental impact of 3D-printed plastic waste is a growing concern, but recycling and degradation methods offer a potential solution. These methods, while having limitations, can contribute to a more sustainable circular economy. Hydrogel-based 3D printing provides a feasible and customizable approach to creating advanced functional biomaterials. Various techniques, such as laser printing, extrusion printing, inkjet printing, and bioprinting, allow for the tailoring of hydrogel properties to meet specific application requirements. Material selection is a critical aspect, with polymeric materials offering distinct advantages over metals, carbon, and other sources. The vast array of available polymers, each with unique properties, makes them well-suited to meet the diverse needs of 3D printing. The choice of process also influences the final properties of the printed products, adding another layer of customization to this versatile technology.
