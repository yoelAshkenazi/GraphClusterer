Three-dimensional food printing is an innovative technology with diverse applications, allowing for the creation of customized food products with specific structures, designs, and nutritional contents. This technique has been applied to various food types, including cereal-based snacks, cookies, and jelly foods, using different printing methods such as extrusion-based, inkjet, and laser-assisted printing. The success of 3D-printed food depends on several factors, including the printability of ingredients, the quality of the final product, and post-processing methods. Printability is influenced by product and printing parameters, as demonstrated in the development of nutrient-dense cookies with underutilized ingredients, where the hardness, rheological behavior, and microstructure were analyzed. Post-processing is a critical step, affecting marketability and consumer acceptability, and involves both cold and thermal settings to ensure stability. Safety, labeling, and legal considerations for 3D-printed foods are essential, addressing challenges such as source and origin transparency, storage stability, and the need for proper labeling. While 3D food printing offers significant potential in the food supply chain, it also faces challenges related to printability, safety, and consumer acceptance. Overcoming these hurdles requires further research and development to realize the full potential of this technology in the food industry.
