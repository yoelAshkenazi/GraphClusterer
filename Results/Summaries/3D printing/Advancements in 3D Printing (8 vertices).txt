3D printing is a versatile technology with a wide range of applications, from manufacturing intricate products to developing materials for various industries. The technology has seen significant advancements, with different printing methods and materials being explored. One key aspect is the use of various materials, including polymers, composites, and nanocomposites, which offer unique properties and enable the production of high-performance parts. 3D printing has been applied to create materials with specific properties, such as adsorbents, where the structure can be manipulated to optimize mass and heat transfer. The technology has also been used to produce clothing, with a focus on using traditional textile materials to improve wearability and comfort. Additionally, 3D printing has been employed to create high-performance thermosets and composites, with novel inks and curing methods enhancing printing speed and mechanical properties. The selection of materials is crucial, as it determines the applications of 3D-printed structures. Polymers, in particular, offer a wide range of choices due to their versatility and can be used in solid, semisolid, and aqueous forms. However, the type of 3D printing process also influences the final product's properties, and optimizing printing parameters is essential for achieving desired outcomes. The technology faces challenges, such as material strength and adhesion in high-concentration nanocellulose structures, and the recycling of 3D-printed waste plastics is an area of concern for environmental sustainability. Despite these challenges, 3D printing continues to evolve, offering new possibilities for material design and manufacturing.
