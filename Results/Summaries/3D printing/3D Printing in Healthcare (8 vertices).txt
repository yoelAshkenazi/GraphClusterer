3D printing is a rapidly advancing technology with significant implications for various industries, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals. This technology allows for the creation of intricate, personalized objects through additive manufacturing processes, offering advantages in terms of customization and efficiency. 3D printing has been applied to the production of orthoses, which have demonstrated comparable or superior performance to traditional orthoses, with high user satisfaction and comfort. The technology is also transforming drug manufacturing, enabling precise control over drug release characteristics and dosage forms, and facilitating the creation of personalized medicines. Several 3D printing methods are available, each with unique capabilities and applications, including Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Sintering, Stereolithography, and Inkjet Printing. The use of natural products as biodegradable and biocompatible materials in 3D printing is being explored, offering potential benefits in terms of safety and environmental sustainability. In the pharmaceutical industry, 3D printing is being utilized to produce personalized tablets, allowing for precise control over drug release rates and dosage forms, but challenges such as powder agglomeration, drug substance incompatibility, and printer head clogging must be addressed, and understanding the rheology of polymers and API-polymer mixtures is essential for successful 3D printing of dosage forms.
