3D printing in the pharmaceutical industry is gaining traction, particularly for drug manufacturing and personalized medicine, offering flexibility in dosage forms and control of drug release through complex geometries. Various 3D printing methods and materials are being explored, including selective laser sintering, binder deposition, stereolithography, inkjet printing, extrusion-based printing, and fused deposition modeling, with the latter being a popular choice due to its affordability and simplicity. Hydrogels are a promising class of materials, offering tailorability and compatibility with various 3D printing techniques, making them valuable for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and other biomedical applications. The 3D printing of tablets presents challenges, but allows for the production of personalized dosage forms and controlled release rates. Multi-axis 3D printing of hydrogels has the potential to overcome limitations of triaxial printers, enabling the printing of non-planar substrates. Overall, 3D printing is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry, enabling personalized medicine, complex dosage forms, and controlled drug release, with hydrogels being a promising avenue for advanced biomedical applications.
