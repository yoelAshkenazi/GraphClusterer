The application of 3D printing technology in medicine is a rapidly growing field, with potential benefits in orthoses, radiology, forensic reconstruction, cardiopulmonary disease, neurosurgery, cardiovascular interventions, surgical planning, and education. 3D printed orthoses have shown promising results in terms of biomechanical and kinematic parameters, as well as patient satisfaction and comfort. In radiology, 3D printing is being used to create anatomical models for diagnostics, surgical planning, and patient education, but there is a need for regulation and quality control to ensure accuracy and safety. The forensic field has also used 3D printing for facial reconstruction, while in cardiopulmonary disease, 3D printed models provide valuable information for surgical planning and education. Neurosurgery and cardiovascular interventions have particularly benefited from 3D printing, with the technology being used to create patient-specific models for preoperative planning and intervention optimization. 3D printing has been employed in surgical planning for mitral valve disease and atrial septal defect, with promising results. The technology has also been used to create organ models for preoperative training and patient education, with the potential for artificial intelligence to enhance the realism and accuracy of these models. 3D printing technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of medicine, from orthoses and radiology to surgical planning and education. However, there is a need for further research and standardization to ensure the accuracy, safety, and effectiveness of 3D printed medical products.
