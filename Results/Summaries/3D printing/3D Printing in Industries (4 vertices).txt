The rapidly evolving field of 3D printing has captured the attention of various industries, particularly optics, photonics, and fashion design, due to its unique capabilities. This manufacturing technique, also known as additive manufacturing, offers significant advantages over traditional methods by enabling the creation of intricate objects with reduced material waste. It facilitates the development of integrated systems and functional devices, such as 3D bio-printed tissues in medicine and innovative clothing designs in fashion. The challenges in 3D printing lie in the need for both advanced printing technology and suitable printable materials for optics and photonics devices. No single manufacturing method can simultaneously achieve small features, low roughness, and high speed. This gap presents opportunities for innovation in 3D printed photonics. The use of 3D printing in fashion design is exemplified by natural aesthetic designs, bionic designs, and the integration of big data, demonstrating the technology's versatility. Characterizing 3D-printed conductors is also essential, employing techniques like infrared thermography and voltage contrast scanning electron microscopy to study their electrical properties, which can enhance the design of 3D-printed transducers and maximize the utilization of 3D-printed materials' electrical characteristics.
