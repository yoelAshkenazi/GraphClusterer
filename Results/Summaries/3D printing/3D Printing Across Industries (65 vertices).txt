3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has gained significant traction in various fields, including medicine, fashion, construction, and education. It is a versatile technology that allows for the creation of complex and personalized objects through the layer-by-layer deposition of materials. The process has evolved from its early days in the 1980s, with advancements in technology and materials making it more accessible and applicable across industries. The use of 3D printing in the medical field includes tissue engineering, drug manufacturing, and surgical planning, with the potential to create personalized medicine and transform pharmacies. Various 3D printing methods and materials are compatible with printing drug products. 3D printing is also used in food production, with the development of 3D-printed molds and food printers, emphasizing the importance of postprocessing methods for safe delivery and marketability. In construction, 3D printing is used in fabricating complex structures and printing concrete without formwork. In education, 3D printing is a valuable tool for teaching and learning, creating complex objects and enhancing student engagement.
