3D printing is an additive manufacturing technology that has seen rapid growth and diverse applications across various industries, including aerospace, medical science, education, and food manufacturing. Since its inception in the 1980s, the technology has evolved, and while it is widely recognized, its principles and capabilities are still being researched and understood. The process involves the layer-by-layer deposition of material, with fused deposition modeling being a common technique for creating polymer components. The surface finish of the printed object is influenced by various parameters, necessitating a thorough review of the 3D printing process to achieve optimal results. The accessibility of 3D printing has been enhanced by the availability of online and local 3D printing services, enabling individuals to bring their 3D designs to life without owning a printer. This democratization of 3D printing is particularly evident in the fashion, jewelry, and furniture industries, where customized 3D-printed products are becoming increasingly popular, and designers play a crucial role in bridging the gap between industry and customers. Research in 3D printing encompasses a wide range of topics, including the use of various materials like lignocellulosic biomass, the impact on education and industry, and the development of new techniques such as extrusion-based 3D printing for high-precision structures. Universities and technical institutions are leading the way in integrating 3D printing into curricula to improve student learning and technical skills, demonstrating the technology's potential to revolutionize various fields.
