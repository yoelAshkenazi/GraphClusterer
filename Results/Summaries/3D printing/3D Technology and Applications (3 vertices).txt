3D technology has been making significant strides in various fields, including the medical and manufacturing sectors. One notable application is the use of 3D-printed orthoses, which have been found to be as effective as, or even better than, conventional non-3D printed orthoses in terms of biomechanical and kinematic parameters. Patients also reported higher satisfaction and comfort with 3D-printed orthoses. This suggests that 3D-printed orthoses could become a viable alternative to conventional ones. A novel method has been introduced to analyze and minimize 3D printing distortions, specifically for polymer 3D printing using MultiJet technology. The theoretical foundations and practical applications of 3D scanning and printing are also explored, emphasizing the importance of understanding the principles of reverse engineering, CAD/CAM systems, and various 3D printing technologies. Practical challenges encountered in the 3D scanning process are discussed, highlighting the need for rigorous testing and analysis to ensure the quality and effectiveness of 3D-based solutions. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical experience, researchers and practitioners can further enhance the use of 3D technology in various fields, ultimately leading to better medical treatments, improved manufacturing processes, and a deeper understanding of 3D scanning and printing techniques.
