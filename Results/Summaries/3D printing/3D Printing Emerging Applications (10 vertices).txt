3D printing technology is gaining traction in various fields, including energy storage devices, batteries, and pharmaceuticals, due to its advantages such as flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to create complex structures. Recent developments and challenges in 3D printing for these applications include the creation of structural energy storage devices, particularly lithium-ion batteries, with improved electrochemical performances. 3D printing technologies are also being utilized to fabricate lithium-ion batteries and other energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries, for special usage scenarios. In pharmaceuticals, 3D printing is enabling personalized medicine and transforming pharmacies, with various methods being employed to create complex drug products with controlled release characteristics. Natural products are being used as biodegradable and biocompatible materials in 3D printing of pharmaceuticals, highlighting the potential of natural excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The fabrication of artificial tissues with vascularized structures is also being explored, emphasizing the importance of rheological properties and material matching for optimal printing quality and performance. Challenges and regulatory aspects of 3D printing in pharmaceuticals include understanding the rheology of polymer-API mixtures and the potential of multi-drug printing. Overall, 3D printing is an emerging technology with vast potential in various fields, but challenges remain, particularly in material selection, process optimization, and regulatory compliance.
