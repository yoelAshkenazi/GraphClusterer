3D printing, a versatile technology, is finding increasing applications across various industries. It offers a unique opportunity in special education by providing three key functions: promoting STEM engagement through 3D design and printing skills, creating educational aids for accessible learning, and producing custom adaptive devices. This is particularly beneficial for students with special needs, as demonstrated across three sites catering to individuals with cognitive, motor, and visual impairments. The 3D printing process involves layer-by-layer printing of a 3D model, often stored in STL format, using a 3D printer and a variety of materials such as ABS, PLA, and composites. This technology is predicted to significantly disrupt mass production processes, especially in industries like automotive, medical, education, and consumer products. The adaptability of 3D printing is further exemplified in energy storage, where researchers have developed 3D-printed lithium-ion batteries with remarkable rate capability, and in construction, where it has been enhanced with carbon fibers to improve mechanical properties and interlayer bonding in printed mortar.
