3D printing technology has gained widespread recognition in various medical fields, including radiology, cardiology, and healthcare systems, offering numerous benefits such as improved visualization of 3D-printed anatomical models, enhanced surgical planning, and patient education. However, the increasing use of 3D printing in healthcare highlights the need for regulation and quality control to ensure accuracy and safety. The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Task Force on 3D printing provides a comprehensive review of the logistical considerations for establishing a clinical 3D printing service, emphasizing the importance of radiologists' involvement in guiding this emerging technology, including printer and software selection, model creation, and research directions. 3D printing has proven its clinical value, especially in cardiopulmonary disease, where complex anatomical structures and pathologies are prevalent, providing valuable insights for surgical planning and intervention, as demonstrated in studies on mitral valve disease and atrial septal defect patients, offering a unique perspective and additional information beyond traditional imaging techniques. The application of 3D printing in mitral valve assessment has undergone early clinical evaluation, and its precision and usefulness require further investigation, with a study developing a prototype method for mitral valve 3D modelling and printing from CT scans, achieving submillimetre precision.
