3D printing technology is a rapidly developing manufacturing process that has found applications in various industries, including construction. It enables the creation of objects through a computer-aided design and manufacturing process, building them layer by layer using materials such as thermoplastics, photopolymers, and concrete. In construction, 3D printing offers significant advantages, particularly in concrete construction, allowing for the 3D printing of concrete structures without the need for formwork, resulting in cost and time savings. However, there are challenges and limitations to be addressed, such as handling ready-mixed concrete with coarse aggregates and maintaining consistent mechanical properties in 3D-printed structures. A 3D concrete printer can directly print ready-mixed concrete, and the Fused Deposition Modeling method can create layer grooves, affecting the mechanical characteristics of the printed structures, but a solution, called 3D-CMF, can address this issue by smoothing the layer grooves. Software for 3D model modification offers easy UI functions for deformation and texture editing based on content-awareness, and suitable structural forms for 3D-printed concrete include hollow, tree, arch, and structure-functional forms. The potential, limitations, and reinforcement methods for 3D-printed concrete are also explored, as well as the economic and environmental benefits of 3D concrete printing technology compared to traditional construction methods.
