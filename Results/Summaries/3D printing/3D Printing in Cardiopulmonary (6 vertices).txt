Three-dimensional printing has gained traction in the medical field, especially in the context of cardiopulmonary diseases, due to its ability to produce personalized models that offer valuable insights for clinical applications. This technology has been applied in various areas, such as creating models for heart and cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, and even ventilators for COVID-19 patients. The accuracy and feasibility of 3D printing have been demonstrated in these contexts, with studies indicating its potential to improve diagnosis and treatment planning. 3D printing is used to create atrial septal defect models, where 3D transesophageal echocardiography images are used to generate highly accurate 3D-printed models, which can aid in clinical decision-making. The use of support material in Fused Deposition Modeling 3D printing has been optimized to minimize material waste while maintaining the structural integrity of the printed objects. 3D printing has been utilized to create patient-specific mitral valve models, which have been deemed useful by cardiac health professionals for preoperative planning and educational purposes. Different 3D printing methods have been explored to determine their accuracy, suggesting the potential for 3D mitral valve models to become valuable clinical tools. Research has been conducted to evaluate the print quality of 3D objects using simulation models, with the goal of optimizing printing parameters for high-quality 3D printing.
