3D printing technology has emerged as a versatile manufacturing technique with applications in various industries, including construction and pharmaceuticals. In construction, 3D printing creates complex structures with enhanced mechanical properties, such as optimizing mechanical performance by adding carbon fibers to 3D-printed mortar, resulting in improved flexural strength and interlayer bonding. In pharmaceuticals, 3D printing revolutionizes drug manufacturing by enabling precise control over drug release characteristics and personalized dosing. The technology allows for fabricating complex 3D printed geometries and architectures that can be engineered to release drugs in a controlled manner. Additionally, 3D printing enables producing precise and unique doses, catering to individual prescriptions and on-demand printing of drugs with limited shelf life or patient-specific medications. Various 3D printing methods have been explored, including selective laser sintering, binder deposition, stereolithography, inkjet printing, extrusion-based printing, and fused deposition modeling. Fused deposition modeling and pressure-assisted microsyringe are popular techniques due to their low cost and simplicity. Natural products like alginate, chitosan, and starch have been employed as excipients, while others like shellac and zein show potential. These excipients play different roles in filament formulation, but challenges such as powder agglomeration, drug incompatibility, and concerns related to resin toxicity need to be addressed. Understanding polymer rheology and polymer-active pharmaceutical ingredient combinations is crucial for successful printing, especially for personalized medicine and multi-drug printing.
