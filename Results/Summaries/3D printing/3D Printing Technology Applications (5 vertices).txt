3D printing technology has found a wide range of applications across various fields, including microfluidics, biosensors, energy storage devices, and electrical property characterization. 3D printing enables the creation of microfluidic nozzles for microdroplet generation, multimaterial mixing, and patterning, as well as the fabrication of microfluidic chips using materials like polydimethylsiloxane, paper, and hydrogels. This technology also allows for in-situ 3D printing on microfluidic chips, leading to functional reaction models with applications in biomedicine and chemistry. 3D printing offers rapid prototyping and simple operation for the production of novel functional devices, including 3D-printed microfluidic, optical, electrochemical, and integrated devices. Energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, have benefited from 3D printing technology, enabling the fabrication of structural batteries with improved electrochemical performance. Characterization techniques for 3D-printed conductors are essential for understanding their electrical properties and optimizing transducer design. The integration of 3D printing technology in these diverse fields offers a promising approach for the rapid production of functional devices and the development of novel applications. Ongoing research aims to optimize the capabilities of 3D printing and overcome its limitations, particularly in terms of resolution and material compatibility.
