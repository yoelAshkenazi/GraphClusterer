3D printing is a powerful technology that can create functional materials and products from 3D virtual models by layering materials in various ways, such as laser printing, extrusion printing, and inkjet printing. The selection of materials is critical, with polymers being the best choice due to their versatility and ability to meet specific requirements. 3D printing is especially useful in the preparation of adsorbents, as it allows for the manipulation of structure to optimize mass and heat transfer processes during adsorption. Different 3D printing techniques have various applications, focusing on the properties of the materials used and the impact of the 3D printing structure on the final product. 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize the clothing industry by using traditional textile materials to create 3D printed fabrics with enhanced properties, offering a wearing experience similar to cotton fabric. The recycling and degradation of 3D printing materials is another important aspect, emphasizing the potential of various recycling methods to reduce waste and promote a circular economy. Hydrogel-based 3D printing is also a promising area, featuring advanced designs and applications in biomedical fields such as tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cancer research. Hydrogel-forming polymers and their customizable properties play a crucial role in creating advanced functional biosystems.
