3D food printing is a technology that enables the creation of food with intricate designs, tailored textures, and personalized nutritional content. The various aspects of 3D food printing include its advantages, applications, and challenges. One of the key benefits is the ability to customize food products, as demonstrated in the development of nutrient-dense cookies using underutilized ingredients and specific printing parameters. However, safety concerns, such as ensuring proper labeling, maintaining storage stability, and adhering to legal frameworks, must be addressed, especially with the globalization of 3D-printed foods. The technology includes extrusion, powder binding, and inkjet methods, each with its own advantages and limitations, and the customization of food design and the potential to alter taste and texture are discussed. The use of hydrogel-based inks in 3D food printing is a promising approach for creating customized food products, but challenges related to printability and mechanical properties still need to be addressed. Overall, 3D food printing offers exciting possibilities for the food industry, but it also faces technical, safety, and regulatory challenges.
