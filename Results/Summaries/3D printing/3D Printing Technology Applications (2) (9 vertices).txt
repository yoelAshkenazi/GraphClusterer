Three-dimensional printing technology is a promising production method with applications across various industries, including construction, material science, and food manufacturing. It enables the creation of intricate shapes and structures by layering materials such as thermoplastics, photopolymers, and concrete. In construction, 3D printing is particularly useful for creating concrete structures, offering cost and time savings compared to traditional methods, but ensuring structural integrity requires careful structural analysis and engineering design. The quality of 3D-printed structures is influenced by the printing method, key parameters, and mix design. Advancements in 3D printing technology have led to the development of new equipment, mixture designs, and testing methods. In material science, the focus is on polymeric materials, composites, and nanocomposites, with research aimed at improving their mechanical and thermal performance and developing materials suitable for specific applications. Additionally, 3D printing has shown potential in food manufacturing, with the development of a 3D food printer capable of printing hydrogels, which could revolutionize the food industry, allowing for the creation of unique food constructs and offering a new approach to food production and customization.
