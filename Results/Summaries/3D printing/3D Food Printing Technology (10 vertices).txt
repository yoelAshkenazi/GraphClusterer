3D food printing is an innovative technology with diverse applications, offering the ability to create custom-shaped food products with tailored nutritional content and texture. The technology has been explored in various fields, including medicine, construction, and the food industry. The process involves layer-by-layer deposition following a digital design, and its success relies on factors such as printability, applicability, and post-processing. Research has focused on optimizing printing parameters and exploring suitable recipes for various food types, ensuring the safety and quality of the final products. Challenges include limited printable materials and the need for effective cleaning protocols to prevent microbiological contamination. The technology is particularly promising for the development of novel foods with complex geometries and customized nutritional profiles. Post-processing is critical, affecting the marketability and consumer acceptability of the products. Both cold and thermal settings are employed to ensure the post-stability of the 3D-printed constructs, and the choice of post-processing method depends on the nature of the material supplies. Combining food nutrition science with 3D printing technology is essential for personalized nutrition, and post-processing methods and sensorial assessments are crucial for ensuring the structural stability and consumer acceptance of 3D-printed foods.
