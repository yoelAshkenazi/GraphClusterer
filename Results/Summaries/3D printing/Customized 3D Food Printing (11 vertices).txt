3D food printing is an innovative technology that offers the ability to create customized food products with unique shapes, textures, and nutritional profiles. This technology has been successfully applied to produce various food items, ranging from simple cookies and chocolates to more complex structures like insect-based proteins and agri-food residues. The process involves several key steps, including the selection of suitable ingredients and printing parameters, the use of different 3D printing techniques, and the consideration of post-processing methods. The ability to customize food products based on individual preferences and nutritional needs is a primary advantage, particularly beneficial for underutilized ingredients, allowing for the creation of nutrient-dense foods with specific structures and designs. However, the printability of ingredients and the quality of the printed food depend on various factors, including product and printing parameters. Safety is critical, requiring proper labeling and storage stability to ensure the safety and edibility of these products. The development of 3D food printing has led to the creation of novel food products, but challenges remain, particularly in improving the printability and mechanical properties of hydrogel-based inks. 3D food printing is a promising technology with the potential to revolutionize the food industry, offering customized, safe, and sustainable food products, but further research and development are required to overcome challenges related to printability, safety, and consumer acceptability.
