3D printing, a technology known as desktop fabrication, is experiencing rapid growth and finding applications across various fields. It involves creating a 3D model, often in STL format, which is then printed layer by layer, akin to inkjet printing. This technology is being utilized in special education to engage students with varying abilities, including those with cognitive, motor, and visual impairments, in STEM subjects, as well as to create educational aids and custom adaptive devices. Researchers have conducted studies in this area, uncovering both advantages and challenges. 3D printing has been employed to develop lithium-ion batteries using LiMn0.21Fe0.79PO4@C nanocrystals, resulting in batteries with exceptional rate capabilities. Additionally, 3D printing is used to create objects, such as 3D models made from PLA material, and holds promise in hydrogel processing, allowing for the printing of non-planar substrates with improved surface quality and reduced reliance on support structures. This technology is poised to disrupt traditional manufacturing processes and impact numerous industries, including automotive, medical, education, and consumer products.
