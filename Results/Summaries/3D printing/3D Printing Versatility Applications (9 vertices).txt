3D printing technology is a versatile and rapidly evolving field, offering innovative solutions across various industries. It enables the fabrication of microfluidic nozzles, chips, and in-situ devices, with applications in biomedicine and chemistry. Nanocomposites printed using 3D technology demonstrate potential for diverse applications, yet challenges remain in achieving the required material strength. The technology is particularly valuable in biosensors and biomedical detection, allowing rapid prototyping of devices such as microfluidic, optical, and electrochemical sensors. 3D printing is also applied in energy storage devices, especially structural batteries, to meet specific application requirements. S-3D printing enhances 3D printing in spatial contexts, improving printability and mechanical strength. A novel ink for high-speed 3D printing of epoxy thermosets offers excellent mechanical properties and printing speed, demonstrating the technology's potential for high-performance applications. Freeform 3D printing is crucial for creating vascularized artificial tissues, with material selection playing a vital role in optimizing the process. 3D printing of cementitious materials is advancing in civil engineering, but standardization and testing methods are still in development, underscoring the technology's adaptability and the ongoing efforts to enhance its capabilities.
