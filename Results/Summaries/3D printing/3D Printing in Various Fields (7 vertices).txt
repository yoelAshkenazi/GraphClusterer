3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a versatile technology with applications across various fields, including dentistry, forensics, engineering, and medicine. The process involves several stages, starting with oral scanning or computed tomography to obtain digital data, followed by digital design, material selection, and printing. The mechanical properties of 3D-printed objects are influenced by factors such as material thermal and rheological properties, printing angles, and techniques. 3D printing is used in dentistry for repair, planting, and orthodontics, where understanding the properties of 3D printing materials is crucial for successful printing. In forensics, 3D printing enables facial reconstruction by creating anatomically accurate skull replicas, enhancing forensic investigations. The strength of 3D-printed parts can vary due to the additive manufacturing process, and these parts should be treated as anisotropic materials. Cooperative 3D printing has been introduced, allowing multiple 3D printers to work together, increasing printing speed and build volume. 3D printing has found applications in orthopedics, enabling the personalized manufacturing of orthopedic devices, and has been explored for fracture healing, with studies demonstrating the potential for successful fracture treatment using customizable 3D-printed implants. Computational methodologies have been proposed to model the failure behavior of 3D-printed parts, offering valuable insights for design and analysis.
