3D printing technology is rapidly gaining traction in the medical field, with applications ranging from preoperative planning and surgical training to anatomical modeling and patient education. This technology is particularly valuable in cardiovascular medicine and neurosurgery, where understanding complex anatomies and planning interventions are crucial. However, as the use of 3D printing expands, there is a growing need for regulation and quality control to ensure the accuracy and safety of 3D-printed anatomical models. Incorporating nanotechnology into 3D printing can improve the properties of 3D-printed medical products and enable the creation of nano-structures for medical applications. Software such as 3D Slicer can address the challenge of doctors lacking technical skills in 3D design by converting medical images into digital models for 3D printing. The perceived value of 3D-printed models by healthcare professionals can be significantly influenced by the choice of 3D printing techniques and materials. Artificial intelligence can play a crucial role in solving complex 3D printing manufacturing problems and improving the realism of 3D-printed organ models.
