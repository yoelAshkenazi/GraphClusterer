3D printing is a powerful manufacturing method with a wide range of applications, including tissue engineering, microfluidics, and the creation of intricate 3D structures. This technique involves the layer-by-layer deposition of materials to create complex objects, offering advantages such as reduced material waste and the ability to produce intricate shapes. 3D printing constructs made from synthetic and natural materials have demonstrated promising cytocompatibility, promoting cell growth and differentiation. Two primary 3D printing techniques are inkjet and extrusion-based methods. Extrusion-based 3D printing enables precise control and fabrication of high-concentration nanocellulose structures, with the challenge of layer adhesion addressed by blending lignin and optimizing printing parameters. Fused deposition modeling is another widely used technique, where the surface finish of the printed component is influenced by various input parameters. In microfluidics, 3D printing, particularly with digital light processing, allows for the construction of microscale 3D structures. The performance of these microfluidic devices is significantly influenced by surface wetting characteristics, which are determined by printing conditions like lamination thickness and direction. Freeform 3D printing is a method for creating complex, vascularized artificial tissues, emphasizing the importance of material selection and matching between the printing ink and supporting matrix. The potential of 3D printing in various fields showcases its ability to fabricate precise and complex structures. The success of 3D printing applications relies on the careful selection of materials, the use of appropriate printing techniques, and the optimization of printing parameters to achieve the desired outcomes.
