3D printing has revolutionized various fields, particularly in medical research and tissue engineering. The technology enables the creation of complex 3D structures with biocompatible materials, cells, and supporting components, which are crucial for tissue regeneration and medical applications. Developing advanced materials and processes is important to enhance the properties of 3D-printed products, especially for medical use. Nanotechnology can be integrated into 3D printing to create novel structures with improved properties. Different 3D printing techniques, such as inkjet and extrusion-based methods, can create scaffolds for tissue engineering, which, when combined with growth factors, can significantly impact cell growth, bone formation, and extracellular matrix enhancement. Hydrogels, polymers, and cells are commonly used materials, and the choice of 3D printer technology is crucial for achieving high cell viability, vascularization, and biocompatibility. The development of advanced materials, integration of nanotechnology, and exploration of multi-axis printing are key areas of focus to enhance the properties and applications of 3D-printed products.
