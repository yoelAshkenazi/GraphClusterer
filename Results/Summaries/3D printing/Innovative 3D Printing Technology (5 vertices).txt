3D printing, or desktop fabrication, is a groundbreaking technology with the potential to significantly impact various industries. It involves creating a 3D model, typically in STL format, which is then used by a 3D printer to create a physical object layer by layer. This technology offers a cost-effective and rapid prototyping method, posing a challenge to traditional mass production processes. The process has been enhanced with mobile device applications that allow for 3D model modification, ensuring successful printing by preserving the model's integrity. 3D printing has a wide range of applications, from creating simple models for surgical planning to more complex uses in medicine. It can be used to create customized surgical tools, implants, and artificial bones or teeth for implantation. It also plays a role in invasive procedures, and has the potential to transform fracture treatment by creating patient-specific implants. The technology's ability to use various materials and its rapid development suggest significant future economic implications, particularly in the manufacturing sector. It can add value to products and potentially reshape trade dynamics.
