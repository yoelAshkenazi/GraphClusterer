The integration of nanotechnology into 3D printing has become a promising method for enhancing medical 3D printing, providing new opportunities for the creation of advanced medical products. This approach involves the incorporation of nanomaterials into the 3D printing material system, allowing for the fabrication of nano-structures with improved properties for medical applications. As 3D printing technology becomes more prevalent in healthcare, there is a growing need for regulation and quality control to ensure the accuracy and safety of 3D-printed products, particularly in the creation of anatomical models for diagnostics, surgical planning, and patient education. 3D printing plays a crucial role in fabricating complex constructs using biocompatible materials, cells, and supporting components. Different 3D printing techniques, such as inkjet and extrusion-based methods, have been employed to create scaffolds that significantly impact cell adherence, proliferation, and differentiation. These 3D-printed constructs, when combined with growth factors, can enhance extracellular matrix, collagen I content, and glycosaminoglycan content, promoting cell growth and bone formation. The use of 3D printing in the medical field has expanded to various surgical disciplines, including neurosurgery, cardiovascular medicine, and endoscopic surgery for skull base tumors. It aids in preoperative planning, individualized implantable materials manufacturing, and biomedical tissue modeling. In cardiovascular medicine, 3D printing has been shown to improve anatomy understanding and surgical planning, with high-quality 3D image data and expert operators being essential for successful implementation. In endoscopic surgery for skull base tumors, 3D printing technology has proven valuable, offering fast printing times and affordable costs, and facilitating surgical simulation and anatomy learning. The potential of 3D printing in creating patient-specific organ models for preoperative training and patient education is significant, with AI being proposed as a powerful tool to enhance the manufacturing process and improve the realism of 3D-printed organ models. However, challenges such as low-resolution MRI/CT images, long consumption times, and insufficient realism still need to be addressed for widespread clinical adoption.
