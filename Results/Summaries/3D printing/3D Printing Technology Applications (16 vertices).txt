3D printing technology has made significant advancements and has various applications across fields, with a major focus on construction and civil engineering. It is a layer-by-layer manufacturing process that offers benefits such as cost and time efficiency, especially in the construction of concrete structures. However, challenges and limitations exist, including the need for structural analysis and novel engineering design to maintain integrity. The mechanical properties of 3D-printed objects are crucial, with studies exploring the effects of print angles and material types on tensile strength. Carbon fibers and additives in mortar mixtures can enhance mechanical properties and printing accuracy. 3D printing parameters also influence print quality, and optimal parameters are suggested for high-quality printing. Developments in equipment, software, and materials include the 3D-CMF method to improve surface characteristics of printed structures. Successful prints, such as a power distribution substation and potential structures on Mars, demonstrate the technology's potential. Evaluating and optimizing 3D printing processes, like S-3D mortar printing, can increase strength and compactness. Understanding failure behavior of 3D-printed parts is essential, with computational methodologies proposed for accurate modeling.
