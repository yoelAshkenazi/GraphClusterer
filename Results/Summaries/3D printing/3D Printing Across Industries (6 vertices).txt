Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing technology that is becoming increasingly popular in various industries, including medicine, forensics, and manufacturing. In medicine, 3D printing is utilized for personalized manufacturing in orthosis, a field that demands customized solutions, and is also applied in stomatology for repairs, implants, and orthodontics. The success of these medical applications heavily relies on the properties of 3D printing materials, which are the subject of ongoing research and development. 3D printing plays a crucial role in facial reconstruction on skull replicas in forensics, involving converting CT scan data into a 3D model and optimizing printing parameters to ensure anatomical accuracy. The quality of the 3D printing process is influenced by the thermal and rheological properties of the printing materials. The mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts vary significantly depending on printing angles and materials, and research is being conducted to explore the tensile strength of 3D-printed objects and understand the anisotropic nature of these parts. Accurate computational models are needed to predict the failure behavior of 3D-printed components, and a novel cooperative 3D printing technique has been introduced to increase printing speed and build volume, with the potential to revolutionize manufacturing and prototyping.
