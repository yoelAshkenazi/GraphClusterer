3D printing technology is increasingly being used in the medical field, especially in the context of cardiopulmonary disease, allowing for the creation of personalized models that provide valuable information for diagnosis and treatment, particularly in complex anatomical structures like the cardiopulmonary system. The process involves using various 3D printing methods, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), to create models that can be optimized for material usage and mechanical properties. The accuracy of 3D-printed models is crucial for their clinical utility, with studies evaluating the precision of 3D-printed models derived from 3D transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE) images, specifically in the context of atrial septal defect (ASD), finding a strong correlation between the measurements taken from the 3D-printed models and the actual surgical parameters. The potential of 3D printing in creating patient-specific models is highlighted in the creation of mitral valve (MV) models, deemed useful by cardiac health professionals for preoperative planning, teaching, and training. Overall, the growing applications of 3D printing in the medical field demonstrate the importance of optimizing printing parameters to ensure accurate and useful models, with the potential to significantly enhance diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical education.
