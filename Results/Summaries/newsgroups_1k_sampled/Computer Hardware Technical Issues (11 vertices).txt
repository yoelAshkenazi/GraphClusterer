A variety of technical topics related to computer hardware and software are discussed, including a Logitech 2-button mouse and the challenge of interfacing it with a non-IBM-compatible system, a debate around insurance rates, motherboard support for VL bus and 50-DX CPU, and technical issues with KA9Q and a GVC NIC-2000 ethernet card, and network and graphics cards. Mark Messier declined an event invitation due to injuries, dispelling rumors of a conflict with Mike Keenan. Kevin Todd has been an Oiler for months, and a writer recalls Steve Williams, a Jewish sportscaster who had a show on KYW in Philadelphia in the 80s. The issues with the network card and graphics card are potentially due to outdated drivers, and alternative viewers are sought for an ATI Graphics Ultra Pro VLB card.
