The fire and whether the "madmen" were inside or outside the compound raised questions about the sanity level of those inside and outside. Paying taxes had no reference to sex or religion on the form, with comments addressing who might be unstable enough to keep children in a building with tear gas or start a fire. The BATF's handling of the affair was acknowledged as bad, raising questions about impostors on national TV cameras, with a suggestion to wait for more light on survivors' conflicting reports. The cheapest price for the Teleport Gold fax modem by Global Village was sought. The moon is unlikely to become a site of major commercial activity due to lack of materials that can't be obtained cheaper on Earth or from asteroids and comets. Exploring it would satisfy curiosity, and its position in the Earth's gravity well could offer military utility, but it holds little commercial value. Space-based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convenient value of G look more promising. Luna has an inconvenient gravity field, too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long-term genetic drift, yet too high for micro-G manufacturing. The seafloors and Antarctica are ignored due to harsh conditions, and lunar development is likely to be pushed back. Luna's main short-term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory or a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system. The AMA was asked about "lives saved" in waiting period states. Advice was sought on buying a Land Cruiser, with the local Toyota dealer having a limited supply. The French Resistance's role in hindering the German war effort was questioned, with the crucial role supplied on D-Day. Lebanon and Israel claimed progress in peace talks, but obstacles remain. A final call for votes was made for the creation of the newsgroup misc.health.diabetes.
