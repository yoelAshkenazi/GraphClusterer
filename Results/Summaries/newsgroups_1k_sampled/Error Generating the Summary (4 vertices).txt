I don't know where to find pkunzip2.04g, but I do have a .Xmodmap file for remapping the arrow keys on a Sun Type-5 UNIX keyboard. This file is a bit "brute force" but it works. It remaps the arrow keys properly and assigns them to keysyms. It also remaps the Back Space key to emit the "Delete" keysym, and maps other random keys that aren't on by default. I believe conspiracy charges are often a result of people jumping to conclusions before all the facts are in. It's easy to cry "whitewash" when the story changes, but it's important to wait for the full picture before making absolute statements.
