The Clipper Chip, a proposed encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), is a solution to the problem of wiretapping "terrorists and drug dealers" and provides greater protection than bare voice. However, there is concern that the government will use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt the Clipper Chip, which could restrict stronger techniques and limit privacy. Concerns are also raised about the algorithm being classified, the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system, and the lack of public involvement in the process. A comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security is needed, with the Clipper Chip considered as part of the inquiry and not adopted before the discussion begins.
