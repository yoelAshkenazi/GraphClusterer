Two approaches to control and differentiation for hypersonic vehicles are presented. The first approach focuses on differentiators using a higher-order sliding mode observer, which offers fixed-time convergence and settling times, ensuring quick and accurate responses. A comparison with the Levant recursive method is made through a missile control simulation, showcasing the differentiator's performance. A fault-tolerant control scheme designed for a hypersonic gliding vehicle involves building a control-oriented model, utilizing observers to estimate actuator faults and model uncertainties, and implementing a finite-time multivariable terminal sliding mode control. This system ensures the vehicle's safety by quickly adapting to faults and uncertainties, as demonstrated in a six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear model simulation. Both approaches aim to enhance the control and differentiation processes for hypersonic vehicles, improving their robustness and accuracy in various scenarios.
