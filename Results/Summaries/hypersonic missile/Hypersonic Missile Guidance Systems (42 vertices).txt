Missile design, guidance, and control topics are covered, including hypersonic airbreathing propulsion development, emphasizing fuel-cooled composite materials for dual-mode ramjet combustors operating at high speeds. A novel guidance law for surface-to-air homing missiles combines proportional navigation with a fuzzy-switching point controller to minimize control effort and miss distance. Computational methods are applied in missile design and analysis, such as a numerical method for solving hypersonic nonequilibrium aerogasdynamics problems and rarefied hypersonic CFD for modeling high-altitude aerothermodynamics of space vehicles. A combinational opposing jet and aerospike concept is proposed for drag reduction of hypersonic vehicles and missiles. The role of missiles in military and defense strategies is examined, including the impact of missile and artillery air defense systems on modern warfare and the history of the Cold War, specifically the Cuban missile crisis and the removal of Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. Technical aspects of missile guidance and control are explored, including a back-stepping controller scheme for hypersonic missiles utilizing adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems for parameter estimation and Lyapunov.
