The ancient town of Malus, also known as Malos, Mallus, or Mallos, holds historical significance across different regions of ancient Anatolia, including Phrygia, Galatia, and Pisidia. It was inhabited during Roman and Byzantine times, and its location varied across these regions, with sites near Gkeyayla, Kalecik, and Saridris in modern-day Asiatic Turkey. The town is associated with the martyrdom of Theodotus of Ancyra in Galatia. The name Malus, derived from Ancient Greek, also has a broader usage in the Latin term "bonus-malus," which refers to a system of rewards and penalties in various business contexts, such as call centers and the insurance industry. The bonus-malus arrangement is a contractual agreement between the buyer and the call center provider, allowing for payments to be exchanged based on performance.
