Various administrative and political divisions around the world include the Liberties of the Tower, a liberty in London that historically provided a defensive perimeter for the Tower of London. A 'liberty' is a medieval English unit where certain royal rights were transferred to private hands, eventually becoming a local government unit. The Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula, a chapel within the Tower of London, highlights the historical and religious significance of such areas. A 'country' is a political entity, which can be a sovereign state, a constituent country, or a dependent territory. In the U.S., a 'section' is a unit of land measurement in the Public Land Survey System, emphasizing the importance of geographical divisions in land management. Administrative divisions include local governments and their role within higher-level administrative units, such as districts, which are subdivisions of provinces in Afghanistan, and municipalities, which are administrative divisions with self-governance rights.
