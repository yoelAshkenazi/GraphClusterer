A Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) is an internationally recognized reference point defining the lower boundary of a stage in the geologic time scale, often based on paleontological changes. The geologic time scale (GTS) is a system of dating Earth's history using rock layers and their associated fossils. The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) is a global organization within the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) that deals with stratigraphy, geology, and geochronology. Lithostratigraphy is a subfield of stratigraphy focusing on rock layers, geochronology, and petrology, while paleontology is the study of ancient life through fossils. Fossils, such as those found in Dorset, England, provide valuable information about past life, including the first appearance datum (FAD) and last appearance datum (LAD) of species. The Jurassic Coast in Dorset is known for its geology and fossils, including the extinct ammonite genus Cardioceras. The Muschelkalk is a Middle Triassic sedimentary rock formation in Europe, and the Late Jurassic epoch is characterized by the Upper Jurassic strata. Geologists and biologists study Earth's history, rocks, and life forms, contributing to our understanding of the planet's past and present.
