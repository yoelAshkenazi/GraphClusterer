A Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) is an internationally recognized reference point that defines the lower boundary of a stage in the geologic time scale, often based on paleontological changes. The geologic time scale, or GTS, is a system of chronological dating that utilizes chronostratigraphy and geochronology to interpret Earth's rock record. The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) is a major organization within the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) that focuses on global stratigraphic, geological, and geochronological matters. Lithostratigraphy, a sub-discipline of stratigraphy, deals with the study of rock layers, primarily igneous and sedimentary, and their formation processes. Paleontology is the scientific study of ancient life, including the examination of fossils to understand organisms and their paleoecology. Fossils, derived from the Latin word 'fossilis', are preserved remains or traces of past life, and they play a crucial role in paleontological research. The IUGS represents a vast community of geoscientists and promotes collaboration in geology. Geological time is divided into epochs and stages, with terms like 'first appearance datum' (FAD) and 'last appearance datum' (LAD) used to mark the presence of species in the fossil record. Strata, or layers of rock, are central to stratigraphy, which has subfields like lithostratigraphy.
