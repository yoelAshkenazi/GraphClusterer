Philip Miller, an English botanist and gardener of Scottish descent, was chief gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden and wrote The Gardeners Dictionary. The definition of a cultivar, the role of plant propagation, and the distinction between annuals, biennials, and perennials in horticulture are discussed, along with specific plant species such as the apple and its various cultivars, like the Golden Delicious and Red Delicious, and the raspberry, a perennial plant in the genus Rubus. Deciduous plants, which seasonally shed leaves, are also introduced. The concept of hybrids, phenotypic traits, and the role of visual perception in interpreting the environment are explored, and the term 'angiosperm' is defined, referring to flowering plants that bear seeds enclosed within a fruit. The family Poaceae, commonly known as grasses, is introduced, and various other topics are touched on, including the definition of a subgenus in zoology, the role of the Royal Society in promoting science, and the application of the term 'apply' in mathematics and computer science.
