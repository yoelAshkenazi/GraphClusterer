The concept of intellectual property encompasses various forms of intangible creations, with trademarks being one of its essential components. Trademarks serve as unique identifiers for products or services, ranging from words, phrases, and symbols to more unconventional forms like 3D shapes, sounds, and even scents. This legal protection ensures that a specific source's offerings are distinguishable from others. The idea of intellectual property originated in England, with its modern development occurring during the 17th and 18th centuries, and it includes other well-known types such as patents, copyrights, and trade secrets. These forms of intellectual property protection are recognized to varying degrees across different countries.
