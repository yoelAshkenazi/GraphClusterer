Intellectual property encompasses various forms of intangible creations, including trademarks, which are a crucial aspect of brand identity. Trademarks serve as distinctive identifiers, setting products or services apart from competitors. They can take many forms, ranging from words, phrases, and symbols to more unconventional marks like designs, 3D shapes, sounds, and even scents. This wide range of options allows for unique and memorable brand recognition. The concept of intellectual property, including trademarks, has its roots in England, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Patents, copyrights, and trade secrets are also part of this category of property, each serving a specific purpose in protecting original ideas and creations.
