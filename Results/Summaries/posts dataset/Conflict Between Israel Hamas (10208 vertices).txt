The conflict between Israel and Hamas has been ongoing for decades, with both sides engaged in a cycle of violence and retaliation. The recent escalation began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israeli cities, killing dozens of civilians and wounding hundreds more. Israel responded with a series of airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza, targeting Hamas infrastructure and leaders. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians, including many children, and has caused widespread destruction in Gaza. The international community has called for an immediate ceasefire, but negotiations have been complicated by the involvement of other regional actors, such as Iran and Egypt. The situation remains tense, with both sides continuing to exchange fire and Israel threatening to launch a ground invasion of Gaza.
