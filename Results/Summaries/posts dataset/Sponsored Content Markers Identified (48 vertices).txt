A series of sponsored content markers in Hebrew, denoted by the symbol "°", is present. The repeated phrase "°תוכן ממומן" translates to "Sponsored Content" and is likely an indicator or label used to identify promotional or sponsored material within a larger text or media context. Each text is separated by the phrase "<New Text:>", suggesting a transition or delineation between different instances of sponsored content.
