The United States, a federal union of 50 states, is a country with a unique federal system. It has dedicated agencies for managing various aspects of its governance, including intellectual property. Trademarks, a form of intellectual property, play a crucial role in distinguishing products and services from different sources. Goods and services are distinct concepts, with goods being transferable and services providing intangible value. Intellectual property encompasses various forms, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and is a well-established concept that originated in England. The European Union Intellectual Property Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office are responsible for registering and managing IP rights, ensuring their protection and harmonization across their respective jurisdictions. The United States Patent and Trademark Office operates on a self-sustaining model, funded entirely by its users' fees.
