A common theme is the mention of different forms of 'Malus' or 'Mallos', an ancient town in Phrygia, Galatia, and Pisidia, located in modern-day Turkey, inhabited during Roman and Byzantine times and holding religious significance, particularly in Galatia, where it was the site of a martyrdom. The term 'Malus' also relates to a genus of small deciduous trees or shrubs in the Rosaceae family, including the well-known apple tree. Philip Miller, an English botanist and gardener of Scottish descent, was the chief gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden in London, a historic botanical garden established in 1673, and is known for writing The Gardeners Dictionary, a highly influential reference series that focused on plants cultivated in England. Molly Crabapple, an American artist and writer, and the concept of 'malt' in the context of brewing and baking are also mentioned.
