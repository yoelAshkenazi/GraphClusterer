Composite materials are widely used in various industries but pose recycling difficulties due to their complex nature. Recycling thermoset-based polymer composites is crucial for adhering to waste management regulations and promoting resource conservation. Improved recycling technologies and more recyclable composite materials are needed, addressing issues like high costs and poor recyclate quality. Mechanical, thermal, and chemical recycling methods are being explored, emphasizing the importance of research and development in this field. A fatigue damage model for composite materials has been introduced to understand their degradation under cyclic loading, accurately predicting damage evolution and fatigue life. Advancing composite material recycling technologies and understanding their mechanical properties is essential for their sustainable use and compliance with environmental regulations. Better recycling methods and more recyclable composites are crucial for the long-term success and environmental impact of these materials.
