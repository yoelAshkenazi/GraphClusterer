Biomass-derived carbons (BDCs) and their composites with conductive materials, such as metals, metal sulfides, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide, are used to enhance the performance of supercapacitors. By combining BDCs with conductive additives, researchers aim to improve conductivity, charge/discharge capabilities, and specific surface area, resulting in higher specific capacitance values. This approach integrates the benefits of electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors, leading to enhanced energy density. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), synthetic two-dimensional nano-structured anionic clays, are also explored as hosts for Azo-compounds to create nano-hybrid materials. Intercalating large anionic pigments like phenyl azobenzoic sodium salt into Zn-Al LDH increases the interlayer spacing significantly, and the resulting nano-hybrid material is used as a filler for polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form nano-composites that exhibit improved thermal stability compared to pure PVA.
