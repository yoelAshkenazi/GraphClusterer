Composite materials and their applications are discussed, focusing on environmental, mechanical, and physical properties. Green composite materials, including metallic, polymer, and cement-based composites, are highlighted for their sustainability and recyclability, gaining interest due to their eco-friendly nature and desirable properties. The concept of dynamic materials, particularly vibrational dynamics, showcases materials that can change their properties under vibration, such as a pipe conveying a pulsating fluid. Graphene and its derivatives are explored as effective nanofillers for polymeric matrices, enhancing their properties for industrial applications, with synthesis methods and modification techniques for graphene-based materials also covered. Analytical models for evaluating residual stresses in polymeric composite materials are reviewed, emphasizing the importance of accurately describing the polymer matrix behavior during curing. Composite materials are also used in railway sleepers to increase load capacity and prepare the railroad system for heavier and faster trains, involving static analysis, finite element modeling, and full-scale testing of reinforced and non-reinforced sleepers, with promising results.
