Various composite materials and their applications in different fields are explored. A polyvinylacetate-based composite with nanopowder fillers is assessed for its radioprotective properties, finding an optimal concentration for enhanced radiation attenuation. The concept of dynamic materials, specifically 'vibrational dynamics', is introduced, examining a pipe with pulsating fluid as an example. Biomass-derived carbons (BDCs) are discussed for use in supercapacitors, focusing on BDC composites with conductive materials to improve electrode performance. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are explored as hosts for Azo-compounds, creating nano-hybrid and nano-composite materials with improved thermal stability. A new composite material for optical oxygen sensors is proposed, offering advantages in microbiological fouling and calibration. Graphene and its derivatives are highlighted as potential nanofillers in polymers, with applications in sensors, batteries, and solar cells. A novel production method using polylactic acid for electronic devices is presented, emphasizing biodegradable polymers and their environmental benefits. Carbon-based composite materials for electrodes are also researched, with various applications.
