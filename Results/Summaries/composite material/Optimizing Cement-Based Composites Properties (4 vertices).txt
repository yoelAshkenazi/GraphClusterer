The potential for directional regulation of properties in cement-based composites is discussed, specifically focusing on the use of limestone waste and other additives. By introducing limestone waste, the crystallization and structure formation of cement stone can be altered, resulting in improved properties. The research aims to create cement compositions that meet various criteria, including technological efficiency, environmental sustainability, and economic viability. Using heat-resistant fillers and modifying the cement matrix with additives like calcium orthophosphate has shown promising results in enhancing the compressive and bending strength of the composite, as well as its heat resistance. The impact of combined field effects, such as ultrasound and magnetic fields, on cement compositions significantly increases the strength of hardened cement paste, mortars, and concretes, with compressive strength increasing by 30-45% on average. These studies provide insights into optimizing the properties of cement-based materials through various techniques, ensuring they meet specific requirements while considering environmental and economic factors.
