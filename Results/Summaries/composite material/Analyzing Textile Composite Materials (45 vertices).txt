Textile composite materials designed for high-temperature applications are analyzed for their properties. A six-layer structural model is proposed to understand these materials, along with mathematical models and calculation methods to determine their mechanical and thermal characteristics. Computed data and experimental results are presented for various matrix and fiber combinations in ablative textile composites, demonstrating their behavior under different heating rates. Furthermore, failure criteria are described for several types of destruction that these composites may experience, including thread breakage, thread instability, delamination, and cracking under specific conditions.
