The development of green composite materials, which are environmentally friendly and sustainable, has gained significant attention due to the growing awareness of material processing's impact on the environment. These composites, including metal, polymer, and cement-based types, offer a recyclable and renewable alternative. Green metal-matrix composites have become popular due to their eco-friendly nature and desirable physical and mechanical properties. Insights into the composition and properties of various green reinforcement and matrix materials within metal matrix composites highlight their applications and fabrication techniques. Recycling composite materials, especially thermoset-based polymer composites, poses a challenge due to their heterogeneous nature. With increasing waste management regulations, there is a growing need for efficient recycling methods for engineering materials from end-of-life products like automobiles and aircraft. Technologies such as mechanical, thermal, and chemical recycling have been developed, but are not yet widely commercialized due to high recycling costs, limited markets, and the inferior quality of recyclates. Continued research and development are necessary to create better recyclable composites and more efficient separation technologies, and joint efforts in design, manufacturing, and end-of-life management will lead to more sustainable solutions.
