Smart materials, a type of functional material, have the ability to sense and respond to various environmental stimuli, such as physical and chemical changes. These materials have found applications in numerous fields, including medicine, protection, security, communication, and textile electronics. Recent advancements and applications of smart materials have focused on their responsiveness to stimuli and their integration into devices and systems. A wide range of smart materials, including polymers, nanomaterials, and composites, have been developed, with various preparation methods, characterization techniques, and applications. Smart materials can be designed to respond to various stimuli, such as temperature, light, electricity, magnetic fields, and mechanical forces, and this responsiveness can be utilized in various applications, such as drug delivery systems, sensors, actuators, and smart textiles. Achieving a balance between crystallinity and processability is a key challenge in the development of smart materials, particularly for crystalline smart materials, which offer advantages over amorphous materials due to their well-defined and regular molecular arrays, but often suffer from decreased processability and mechanical properties. Strategies to overcome these challenges include chemical/physical modifications and the establishment of macroscale smart material systems. Printing strategies also play an important role in the development of smart materials.
