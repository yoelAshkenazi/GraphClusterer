The field of biomaterials is evolving, particularly in the area of smart biomaterials for tissue repair and regeneration, which is becoming increasingly important as the population ages. Smart biomaterials can be categorized into four degrees of smartness based on their interaction with the biological environment. In the context of articular cartilage repair, smart biomaterials regulate cell behavior and enhance tissue regeneration through controlled drug release and tailored structural properties. Mechanoluminescence, a phenomenon where mechanical force generates light energy, has applications in various fields, with a focus on strontium-aluminate-based materials due to their unique properties. The latest research, synthesis techniques, and applications of these smart materials are being explored, as well as their potential future uses in wearable devices and energy-efficient lighting.
