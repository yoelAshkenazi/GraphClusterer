Smart materials have various applications across different fields. Smart biomaterials can enhance bone and tooth regeneration, modulate biofilms, and combat infections in hard tissue repair and regeneration. Magnetically controlled smart materials allow for remote manipulation and wireless control of printed structures, particularly in harsh environments, through 4D printing technology. Water and temperature-reactive smart materials can simplify product design and create self-actuating devices via 4D printing. Active and smart biodegradable packaging materials can enhance food safety and quality while reducing environmental impact in the food industry. Self-passivating Metal Alloys with Reduced Thermo-oxidation (SMART) can improve safety and performance in fusion power plants. Supramolecular materials can be used for smart windows, and combining electrospinning with smart materials can create smart fibers in textiles. Smart materials can also be used to create adaptable prostheses in cardiovascular implants through 4D printing. MXene-enabled flexible electronics have potential in healthcare, energy, and human-machine interfaces for wearable devices. Smart alloys can suppress oxidation and be joined with other materials for use in fusion power plants.
