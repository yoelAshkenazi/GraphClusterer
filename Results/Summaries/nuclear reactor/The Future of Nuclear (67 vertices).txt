The future of nuclear energy is a multifaceted and complex topic, encompassing various aspects of reactor design, safety, fuel cycles, and economic considerations. Nuclear reactors are important in addressing global warming, with potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a cleaner energy mix. Different reactor types, including Pressurized Water Reactors, Small Modular Reactors, and Multi-Purpose Research Reactors, offer distinct advantages such as enhanced safety features, modularity, and improved fuel efficiency. Safety is critical, with developments in inherently safe reactor designs, such as lead-bismuth coolant and passive safety systems. Research reactors advance nuclear technology and address safety concerns. Nuclear fuel cycles and waste management are significant challenges, with proposed solutions including minor actinides as fuel, closed fuel cycles, and molten salts in fuel processing. The economic viability of nuclear power is a recurring theme, with modular reactors, such as the SVBR-75/100, potentially increasing investment attractiveness.
