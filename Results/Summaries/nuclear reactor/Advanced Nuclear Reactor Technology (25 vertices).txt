Nuclear reactor technology is being advanced to improve safety, efficiency, and control systems, with nuclear energy seen as a sustainable, clean, and safe solution to increasing global energy demand. The development of innovative nuclear energy systems, such as Generation IV reactors, aims to replace current Gen II/III reactors. Control strategies like adaptive robust control, robust observer-based nonlinear control, and observer-based adaptive robust feedback-linearization control are being explored to maintain bounded xenon oscillations during load-following operations. Accurately estimating xenon and samarium concentrations is crucial, and techniques like Extended Kalman Filters and modified higher-order sliding mode observers are proposed. Advanced modeling techniques, including point reactor core modeling and multi-node kinetics reactor models, are being reviewed, along with novel approaches using cellular neural networks and equivalent electrical circuits to model and solve the nuclear reactor's dynamic equations. Safety concerns are being addressed, including the use of heat pipes as control devices.
