Various experimental and analytical methods are used to study the dynamics and aerodynamics of different objects, such as delta wings, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and cable models. A simple analytical model simulates the complex dynamics of a delta wing in a wind tunnel, providing insights into nonlinear aerodynamics. Experimental studies are crucial in UAV development, with a novel laboratory stand and methodology proposed to address the challenges of evaluating modern UAV flight dynamics, including controlling air flow speed and studying the aircraft's center of mass position. Wind tunnel investigations of a stationary iced cable model use experimental icing and 3D printing techniques to create an accurate model for aerodynamic studies, determining the Strouhal number over a range of Reynolds numbers. These studies collectively showcase the application of experimental and mathematical modeling techniques to understand and predict the behavior of various aerodynamic systems, contributing to advancements in fields such as aviation and civil engineering.
