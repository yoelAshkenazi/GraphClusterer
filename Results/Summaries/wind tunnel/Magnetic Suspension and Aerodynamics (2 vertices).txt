Magnetic Suspension and Balance Systems (MSBS) have been developed and applied in wind tunnels within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to address specific challenges in aerodynamics research. The system aims to accurately measure aerodynamic loads on aircraft models without interference from mechanical supports, and study base pressure. It features an electromagnetic setup, position sensing capabilities, and control mechanisms, including high-angle-of-attack and roll control. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MSBS in digital control and aerodynamic testing. Meanwhile, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic is being evaluated as a material for manufacturing aerodynamic models using additive technology, specifically FDM. The study investigates the physical and mechanical properties of ABS samples at normal and negative temperatures, examining their structural characteristics and failure modes. The goal is to assess the suitability of ABS plastic for creating various models used in wind tunnel experiments. These innovative approaches aim to improve wind tunnel testing capabilities, enhancing the accuracy of aerodynamic measurements and making the testing process more efficient and effective.
