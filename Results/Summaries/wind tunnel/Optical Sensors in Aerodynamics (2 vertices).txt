Specialized paints are used as optical sensors for various measurements in wind tunnel experiments, offering advantages and applications. Luminescent sensor paint is utilized for pressure measurements on aircraft models, providing a fast response time, stability, and high accuracy compared to traditional methods. This technique provides valuable data in transonic wind tunnels, with results differing by less than 2% from conventional pressure tap methods, and enables semi-quantitative pressure measurements in shock wind tunnels at high Mach numbers, revealing previously unobtainable information. Temperature-Sensitive Paint technology is employed for studying boundary layer transition on flat plates in short-duration wind tunnels at high Mach and Reynolds numbers, allowing for the investigation of both natural and induced boundary layer transitions. These optical sensor-based techniques enhance wind tunnel testing capabilities, providing new insights and accurate data for various aerodynamic studies.
