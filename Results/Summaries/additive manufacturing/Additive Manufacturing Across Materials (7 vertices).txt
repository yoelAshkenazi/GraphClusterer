Additive manufacturing (AM) and its applications across different material types are discussed, focusing on various aspects of the technology. The use of AM for producing bulk cermets, a unique class of materials combining ceramics and metals, highlights the advantages of AM over conventional methods and lists specific AM processes used for cermet fabrication. AM is also explored in the context of piezoelectric materials, detailing its benefits, technical impact, and future research directions, as well as the processes involved and the development of slurries for different piezoelectric materials. Additive technologies are broadly overviewed, including their definition, types, and a general assessment of their positive and negative aspects. The mechanics of AM processes, particularly for metal-based materials, are examined, including how they influence microstructure and properties, alloy creation, adaptation, and the potential for functionally graded alloys. Specific additive technologies for metal powder parts, such as selective laser melting and coaxial laser melting, are discussed, as well as the advantages of AM in creating polymer-based structures, especially complex ones, and the need for high-performance polymer composites. Various AM methods for polymeric composites and their applications, advantages, and challenges are introduced. A comprehensive view of additive manufacturing is offered, comparing it with classical production methods for complex products, covering specific AM technologies, powder material production and properties, spheroidization technology, and software tools for modeling additive manufacturing processes.
