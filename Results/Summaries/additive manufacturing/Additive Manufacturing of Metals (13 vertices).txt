Additive Manufacturing is a rapidly growing field that has revolutionized the production of complex parts across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, medical, and more. Metal AM processes, such as Selective Laser Sintering and Electron Beam Melting, offer advantages in creating functional and geometrically intricate parts, but have limitations, including high production costs, residual stress, and anisotropic mechanical properties. AM technologies can be classified into seven groups, with four being suitable for metal processing, including Powder Bed Fusion and Direct Energy Deposition. Each technology has its advantages and disadvantages, and the materials used, machine parts, and process parameters are also important considerations. Hybrid additive manufacturing has the potential to enhance part quality and performance, while defect inspection methods are crucial to ensure the quality and safety of final parts. The unique thermal cycle of metal AM and its influence on residual stress is a critical issue affecting part functionality. The formation of pure copper parts through AM is challenging, but potential solutions are being explored. Automated testing and characterization of AM can help streamline the testing process and reduce costs.
