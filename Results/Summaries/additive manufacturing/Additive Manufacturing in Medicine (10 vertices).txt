Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a rapidly growing field with diverse applications across industries. The use of additive manufacturing in the medical field allows for the creation of customized implants, prosthetics, and medical devices tailored to individual patient needs. The process involves building complex parts layer by layer, allowing for the creation of intricate structures that mimic biological tissues. Various additive manufacturing techniques, such as selective laser sintering/melting, laser engineering net shaping, and binder jet 3D printing, each have unique capabilities and applications. Different materials, including polymers, metals, and cermets, are used, with a focus on their properties and suitability for specific medical applications. Additive manufacturing has been particularly transformative in dentistry, enabling the creation of patient-specific dentures and prosthodontic frameworks. The technology also facilitates virtual surgical planning, where surgeons can practice on 3D-printed organs before actual surgery, enhancing safety and precision. Challenges and opportunities presented by additive manufacturing include the need for improved accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. There is potential for using novel materials and understanding the printability of alloys is important to ensure the creation of high-quality, defect-free components. Advancements in printers and materials have expanded the possibilities in the emerging field of metal additive manufacturing in dentistry.
