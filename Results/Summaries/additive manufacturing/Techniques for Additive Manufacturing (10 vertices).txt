Various additive manufacturing techniques are used to create ceramic, metallic, and composite materials. Ceramic fabrication is achieved through traditional slipcasting and additive stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing methods, which are compared for accuracy, surface roughness, and porosity. Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising method for producing metallic objects with complex geometries, offering improved productivity and reduced negative effects through laser beam profiling. Laser polishing enhances the surface quality of additively manufactured Inconel 718 alloy, reducing surface roughness and improving microstructure, micro-hardness, and wear resistance. Optimal parameters are selected for printing latent cured epoxy systems to scale up the process for large-scale 3D printed epoxy composite tooling applications. The microstructure and mechanical properties of additively manufactured metallic materials are examined, focusing on premature failure mechanisms and introducing a submicron structure to enhance strength and ductility. A computational approach simulates the deformation response of additively manufactured aluminum alloys using a microstructure-based constitutive model and explicit time integration scheme. Post-manufacture heat treatment impacts the mechanical strength of additively manufactured austenitic stainless steel, optimizing its structure and properties through careful annealing. A method is proposed for determining the strength of additively manufactured composite samples, addressing the challenge of accurately assessing strength indicators in printed structures. The impact properties of additively manufactured polylactic acid (PLA) parts are explored, investigating the influence of manufacturing parameters like infill density and notch angle on impact behaviors and damage mechanisms.
