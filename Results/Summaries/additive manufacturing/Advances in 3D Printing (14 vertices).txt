Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has gained significant attention in various industries, including electronics, energy, construction, and healthcare. The advancements, challenges, and potential of 3D printing in these fields are discussed, covering a wide range of topics, from recent progress in 3D-printed batteries using different printing methods to the use of AM in creating bone tissue engineering scaffolds. The advantages of AM processes, such as design freedom, resource efficiency, and functionality, are highlighted, along with the trade-offs in printing resolution and scalability. The potential of multi-material, multi-modulus, multi-scale, multi-system, multi-dimensional, and multi-function AM is emphasized for various applications. The impact of AM on sustainable manufacturing is discussed, emphasizing its role in reducing waste, enhancing customization, and improving economic competitiveness, but challenges related to implementing AM as a sustainable manufacturing method are acknowledged. The fabrication of functional metal parts using AM processes like powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition is explored, addressing the critical issue of residual stress and its mitigation. The potential of 3D printing in the construction industry is also explored, focusing on concrete printing for sustainable construction and architectural projects, emphasizing the importance of concrete mixture composition for successful 3D printing, along with the benefits of on-site construction and increased labor productivity.
