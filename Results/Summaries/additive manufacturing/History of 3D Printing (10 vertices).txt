The history and evolution of additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, began in the 1980s with the invention of stereolithography in Japan. Since then, numerous techniques have been developed, each offering unique capabilities and applications. The technology has advanced from rapid prototyping to producing complex structures with various materials, including ceramics, piezoelectric materials, and even bio-printing of organs. The development of additive manufacturing technology has enabled the production of piezoelectric ceramic, polymer, and composite materials, but technical challenges remain and future research directions are being explored. Additive manufacturing is also being used in the aerospace and defense industries, where defect inspection methods are crucial for improving the surface quality and mechanical properties of components. The technology has the potential to simulate complex structures, such as polymer-based lubrication, and has applications in bone tissue engineering, where it can be used to create customized scaffolds.
