Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has seen significant advancements and applications across various industries, particularly in medical and engineering fields. This technology allows for the creation of complex three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer, enabling the production of patient-specific implants, surgical tools, and customized parts for aerospace and automotive industries. AM offers several advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, including the ability to create intricate designs, high material utilization, and support for tissue growth in medical applications. The process involves using a 3D slicing program to divide a CAD model into layers, which are then converted into machine-readable instructions. Different AM techniques are employed, such as Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), Direct Energy Deposition (DED), and Binder Jetting, each with its own advantages and applications. The selection of materials is crucial in AM, with polymers, metals, ceramics, and even biological materials being used for various applications. AM enables the creation of metamaterials and cell structures, which can be optimized for specific properties like strength, fatigue lifetime, and wear performance.
