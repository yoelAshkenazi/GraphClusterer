Additive manufacturing (AM) and its applications across different industries showcase the ongoing technological transition in manufacturing. The concept of Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0 integrates Industry 4.0 and sustainability to balance product, process, and systems in manufacturing, with AM offering better-performance products, customized and cost-effective processes, and reduced waste. Specific AM techniques, such as selective laser melting and laser polishing, offer advantages like producing complex metallic objects and enhancing surface quality. AM is applied in various fields, including construction, where 3D printing with concrete enables unique structural elements, and biomedicine, where AM of biodegradable metals shows potential for bone substitution. Challenges and improvements in AM are also addressed, including the need for improved adhesion between layers in construction printing and the proposal of an improved discrete slicer algorithm for multi-axis 3D printing. The versatility of AM is demonstrated through its use in various materials, showcasing its potential to revolutionize manufacturing processes and product design across industries.
