Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the production of various materials, including cermets and polymeric composites. The application of additive manufacturing techniques in the fabrication of these materials has the potential to impact different industries. In the field of cermets, processes like selective laser sintering/melting and binder jet 3D printing have been explored to create bulk cermet components, offering advantages over traditional methods such as powder metallurgy and casting. By combining ceramic and metallic properties, cermets produced through additive manufacturing can overcome the limitations of conventional production techniques. Additive manufacturing has also been employed to enhance the manufacturing of polymer-based structures, particularly polymeric composites, using methods like stereolithography, selective laser sintering, and fused deposition modeling to create high-performance polymeric composites with improved mechanical properties. The benefits of additive manufacturing in this context include cost-effectiveness and the ability to produce complex parts with high precision. The potential applications of these additively manufactured polymeric composites include biomedical, automotive, and aerospace industries, with advantages, limitations, and future prospects. In both cases, additive manufacturing technologies provide innovative solutions for producing advanced materials, offering new opportunities for various sectors by addressing the limitations of conventional manufacturing methods.
