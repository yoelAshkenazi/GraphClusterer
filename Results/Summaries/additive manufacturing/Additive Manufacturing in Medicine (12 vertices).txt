Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has been a game-changer in the medical field, particularly in the production of personalized implants and scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. This technology allows for the creation of complex structures with precise control over external shape and internal porosity, which is crucial for scaffolds to mimic the natural bone extracellular matrix and promote cell growth. Various techniques, such as selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, and electron beam melting, offer unique advantages in fabricating scaffolds with specific properties. However, each method also has limitations, such as insufficient densification, low mechanical strength, or poor surface quality. Post-treatments are often applied to improve the overall performance of scaffolds, and the design of these scaffolds is a critical aspect. The use of additive manufacturing in bone tissue engineering has led to the development of multifunctional biomaterials, which can enhance bone tissue regeneration and osseointegration. The potential of additive manufacturing in the medical field is vast, and it is estimated to grow significantly in the coming years, but challenges remain, particularly in the development of suitable biomaterials and the resolution of processes for creating complex, small-scale structures.
