Additive manufacturing is a versatile technology with a wide range of applications across various industries, from medical and marine to aerospace. The process offers unique advantages, such as the ability to create complex, personalized designs with reasonable time and cost efficiency. It is particularly promising in the medical field, where it enables the creation of patient-specific implants, surgical models, and cutting guides, potentially leading to fully personalized orthopedics. The use of additive manufacturing in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is also explored, with bioactive glasses being a promising material for 3D-printed scaffolds used in tissue regeneration. Additive manufacturing can overcome the limitations of traditional beam-based methods, offering more flexibility and new possibilities for manufacturing. It can revolutionize jet engine design and manufacturing by enabling the use of gradient materials and micro-structures. The mechanical and microstructural properties of additive manufacturing products are investigated, emphasizing the importance of understanding these characteristics for various applications. The effect of post-manufacture heat treatment on the mechanical strength of additive manufacturing stainless steel is studied, demonstrating the ability to optimize its properties through controlled annealing.
