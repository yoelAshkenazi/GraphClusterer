Additive manufacturing (AM) and its applications are explored across different industries, including the concept of Sustainable Manufacturing 4.0, which integrates Industry 4.0 and sustainability. AM has the potential to improve product performance, reduce waste, and contribute to sustainability, but some unresolved issues remain. The use of AM in creating formwork systems for complex monolithic walls can reduce weight and improve concrete surface quality. A methodology for identifying products suitable for AM has been introduced, dividing them into subsets based on economic feasibility and grouping them according to manufacturing methods. AM has been compared to traditional manufacturing methods, particularly injection molding, with discussions on cost analysis for making informed decisions. The software aspects of AM, specifically the CAD model and the challenges associated with the STL file format, have been examined. Challenges in transferring laboratory research in additive manufacturing of large-size products into concrete items for various industries have been identified. The economic sustainability of AM technology in rapid prototyping has been analyzed, finding that while it leads to cost reduction, it may not be as profitable as conventional manufacturing. The adoption of AM across different sectors has been explored, emphasizing economic motives and the technology's ability to produce complex designs. AM has been applied in marine vessel component manufacturing, radio-frequency applications, and the creation of lightweight and pressure-resistant propellers for autonomous underwater vehicles. A network-based model for centralized and decentralized control schemes has been introduced. The potential of AM and additive design in jet engine part manufacturing has been highlighted, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between design and manufacturing. A systems design approach has been proposed to evaluate AM in new design projects, providing a standardized process and criteria for decision-making. The successful integration of topology optimization and AM in designing a lightweight aerospace bracket has been showcased, reducing mass by over 18%. Overall, the diverse applications and potential of AM have been demonstrated, ranging from sustainable manufacturing to aerospace engineering, while also acknowledging the challenges and considerations in its implementation.
