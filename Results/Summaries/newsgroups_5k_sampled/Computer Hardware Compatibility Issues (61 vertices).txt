Various technical aspects of computer hardware and software are discussed, including video cards, serial ports, modems, and network connectivity. The compatibility of S3-based video cards with specific port addresses is discussed, along with the expansion slot configuration in the Macintosh SE/30, and the challenges of identifying and using a multi-port serial board. Printer compatibility issues are also addressed, including a Panasonic kpx 1124i printer driver, the EISA version of the Orchid ProDesigner IIS, and the upcoming support for accelerated chipsets in XFree86 2.0. Network connectivity issues are also discussed, including installing NCSA telnet over AppleTalk, upgrading to HP-UX 9.0 for R5 server and libraries, and building a loopback connector for a serial port. Other topics include setting up a small accounting system using Windows for Workgroups and Ethernet cards, the Intel SatisFAXtion Modem/100 INTERNAL, and the bandwidth requirements for DV/X. Devices that can increase the number of serial ports on a Mac are also discussed, along with the differences between PDS and Nubus expansion slots. Modem compatibility issues are addressed, including an internal modem for a Mac, the SupraFaxModem V.32bis, and the limitations of Windows RS-232C serial datacomm support. The benefits of upgrading to 16550 UARTs are also discussed, along with the PowerBook 170 4/40 with Fax/Data modem, and the HyperCard stack called "Which Mac Do I Buy?" Hardware compatibility issues are also addressed, including the socket for the MC68851 PMMU chip on a Mac II, the pinouts for the Mac II SCSI DB-25 interface, and a high-speed A/D PC-Board. ISDN and modem compatibility are also discussed. Hardware troubleshooting topics include a WANGTEK tape controller card, the availability of Windows NT on various processors, a CDROM audio cable, and connecting multiple pointing devices to a single serial port. Printer compatibility issues include a Postscript PPD for a Versatec A0-size plotter, building a loopback connector for a serial port, a WINDOW 3.1 driver for a Cornerstone DualPage video card, and the benefits of a 14.4k fax/data modem. The QA Plus diagnostic disk, the MC1489 and MC1488 TTL->RS232-Converter chips, the Winsock compliant version of WinTrumpet, and capturing Windows 3.1's output of the printer manager are also discussed. Hardware sales topics include an Intel 9600 Baud Modem, a Parallel Port Digital to Analogue Converter, initializing an S3 card, and the limitations of the HINT chipset for 32-bit EISA DMA. The internal modem of the Performa 450, a trade for a new modem, a 14.4 v.42bis modem, and the benefits of going direct to National Semiconductor for UARTs are also discussed. Finally, hardware troubleshooting topics include a Logitech Series 7 bus mouse, the Ascension bird device driver for XWindows, the use of the bi-directional printer port, and the compatibility of various parallel port configurations.
