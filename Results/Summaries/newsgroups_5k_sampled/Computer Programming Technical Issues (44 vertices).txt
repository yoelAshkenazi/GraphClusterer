Various technical issues and challenges related to computer programming and software development are discussed. A problem involving a rectangular mesh in the UV domain, which is a mapping of a 3D Bezier patch into 2D, needs to be solved by splitting the trimming area into individual smaller cells bounded by trimming curve segments and outputting them as a whole if they are wholly inside the area. A DOS version of the crypt program that uses six-letter keys is being sought, as well as the exit codes for DOS commands, specifically for the COPY command, to create a "move" batch file. A program that can determine if a color cell is read-only is also needed, to use any read-only cells that are already in the colormap once allocatable cells start running out. The TIFF spec is being criticized for its complexity and the choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless data. Code to record to an Abekas A66 from a minivas-2 is being sought, as well as an FTP site for minivas and Abekas code. The meaning of an "expected error" in the context of NASA Select is being questioned. A list of all polygons in order is being requested, and information about the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, including rules, guidelines, and entry format, is being sought. The "agrep" tool, a powerful similarity pattern matching tool, is being looked for, along with its source and documentation. Help with managing sliders in XView is also needed, specifically with controlling the length of editable numeric fields. Overall, the topics cover a wide range of technical issues related to computer programming and software development, including file formats, compilers, error handling, and user interface design.
