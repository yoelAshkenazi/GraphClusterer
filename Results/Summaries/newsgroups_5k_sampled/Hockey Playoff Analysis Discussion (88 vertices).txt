The absence of a Chicago-Detroit series in a classic playoff year is odd given the excitement of such games. The Habs-Nords game saw the Habs lead 2-0 before the Nords tied and eventually won in overtime. A female hockey fan wonders if she is the only one and shares predictions for the first round of the playoffs. Chicago-Detroit games are exciting, and it is questioned why no one has picked Chicago to win. Paul Kuryia's possible inclusion in the Canadian World Hockey team and the importance of team chemistry in winning games are discussed. A Flyers-Sabres game saw the Flyers' strong defense and the Sabres' struggles, with the Flyers' roster moves, injuries, and team record watch also discussed. The Sabres' lack of a power forward with talent is a major issue. Chicago has a better record than Toronto, questioning the latter's chances of winning. Tom Barasso's cheap shots and the lack of corresponding increase in other goaltenders' dirty play are noted, along with Glenn Anderson's kicking incident and the possibility of an automatic suspension for a non-kicking match penalty. The Los Angeles Kings' MVP, biggest surprise, and biggest disappointment are discussed, with various players suggested for each category, including Robitaille, Zhitnik, Hrudey, Knickle, Melrose, Carson, and Donnelly.
