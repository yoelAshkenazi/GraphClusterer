Various technical issues and software compatibility concerns relate to different operating systems and programming tools, focusing on DOS, Windows, and OS/2. Specific references are made to different versions of DOS, such as DOS 5 and DOS 6, and their compatibility with various applications and utilities. DOS 6 causes issues with Windows apps and Norton DOS 7.0, and some utilities no longer work, raising questions about any potential advantages of DOS 6 over DOS 5 in terms of application support. Upgrading from C7 to Visual C++ (VC++) is also discussed, clarifying the differences between the two and the availability of upgrade paths, with VC++ being a Windows product and not an upgrade for DOS utilities, but considered an upgrade for C7. The compatibility of MFC with Borland C++ is also an issue, with problems with function overloading and static/global object initialization. A 68HC16 emulator is available at oak.oakland.edu, and Borland C++ with Application Frameworks 3.1 is for sale, including various software and manuals. Choices between Stacker 3.0 and DOS 6.0 with Double Space for hard drive optimization are discussed, as well as the incompatibility of a LocalTalk board with certain operating systems, causing crashes. Help is sought for a print-screen issue when running DOS 5.0 under Windows 3.0, possibly related to the expanded memory manager.
