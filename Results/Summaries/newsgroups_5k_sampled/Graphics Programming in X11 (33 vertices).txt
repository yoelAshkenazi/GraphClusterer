A wide range of topics related to graphics programming are covered, with a focus on X11 and Motif. The SHAPE extension used in the oclock widget requires subclassing to add functionality due to lack of wide support. A request is made for software to convert 3D data into a wireframe surface with hidden lines removed. The Xew widgets have a new version available but no new functionality. Masking and clipping can be achieved using a bitmap with a mask. The Graphics Library (GL) and PEX (graPHIGS) are discussed for graphics programming in X applications, with a focus on X and GL compatibility. The GL widget is a possible solution, but Xlib calls compatibility with GL is unclear. Specific graphics problems discussed include removing distortion from a scanned image, creating contour lines from random data points, and finding the center and radius of a sphere given four non-coplanar points. Widgets for displaying images are also discussed, including the Athena Plotter Widget and using a PD widget for 8-bit grey-level images. Various algorithms and techniques are covered, including edge detection, Delaunay Triangulation, and Least Squares Estimation for sphere estimation, as well as anti-aliasing, hidden plane removal, and z-buffering for isometric perspective in games.
