Turkey and Greece, Armenia, and Cyprus have had ongoing political and military conflicts, particularly regarding recognition of Macedonia, the Armenian genocide, and Turkey's role in World War II. Greece is accused of threatening the European Community and blocking Macedonia's recognition, while Armenia is criticized for its role in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims and its anti-Turkish policy. Turkey highlights its humanitarian efforts during World War II, including rescuing Jews from Nazi persecution and protecting Turkish citizens in Europe. The situation in Cyprus is marked by Turkey's 1974 intervention in response to Greek oppression and the desire for 'enosis'. The Lezghis seek independence, and the Turkish minority in Greece faces mistreatment. An Armenian-Nazi conspiracy occurred during World War II, and mass murders of Jews took place in the West Bank between 1936-1939. Greece is criticized for human rights violations against the Turkish minority in Western Thrace and persecution of Turkish parliament members. Kubilay Kultigin urges fellow Turks to respond to Armenian and Greek online postings.
