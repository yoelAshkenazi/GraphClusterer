The X Window System is a graphical user interface and windowing system for bitmap displays. Xlib is the basic library of X Window System, providing the main interface to the X protocol. Xlib includes functions for managing windows, drawing graphics, and handling events. Xlib is used in various applications, such as Motif, OpenWindows, and X11R5, and in conjunction with other libraries, such as Xt and Xaw. Xlib provides various features, such as the ability to "tee" an X program identically to several displays, and to build the X distribution. Xlib has some limitations, such as the inability to compile X11R4 on the older Sun3, and the need to link to the Xlib shape routines. Xlib is a powerful tool for developing graphical user interfaces and windowing systems.
