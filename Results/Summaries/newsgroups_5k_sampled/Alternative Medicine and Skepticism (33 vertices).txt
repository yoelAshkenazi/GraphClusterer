Alternative medicine, specifically homeopathy, is met with skepticism by the scientific community due to its absurd theories and lack of scientific basis, except for herbalism. The placebo effect is prevalent in both alternative and conventional medicine, and anecdotal evidence is questioned. The Rhine experience, where a scientist's lab was filled with chicanery and fakery, may contribute to the reluctance to investigate the paranormal. Some argue that homeopathy can offer help in areas where modern medicine is helpless, and that the scientific community should be open-minded about it. The New England Medical Journal's 1984 statement that 90% of diseases are not treatable by drugs or surgery has implications for alternative medicine. Quackery in medicine is a concern, and the indiscriminate use of the term "quack" is a sign of incompetency. Doctors and medical students who refuse to have an open mind about alternative treatments should create their own moderated group. An open mind is necessary when reading about homeopathy, and being aware of one's own biases and beliefs is important. Seeking a second opinion when a doctor recommends a treatment that the patient does not think is necessary is also important.
