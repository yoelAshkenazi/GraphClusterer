Events in Israel and Gaza are the primary focus of various topics. An area in the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City was attacked. Families of abducted individuals plan a four-day march from Gaza to Jerusalem amid progress in negotiations. Ben Golden, possibly a public figure, visited and the event was visually documented. Bots impersonating Israelis or writing in Hebrew aim to incite hatred and disputes among the Israeli population, with several Palestinian or Iranian bots spreading a specific message to manipulate online discourse. An alarm sounded in the northern community of Mattat, where two rockets fell in open areas, and the Israel Defense Forces responded with artillery fire towards the source of the launch.
