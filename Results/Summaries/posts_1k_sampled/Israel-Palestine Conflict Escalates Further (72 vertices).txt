A series of military actions and diplomatic responses are unfolding in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, Khan Yunis, and Lebanon have led to casualties and significant destruction. The Israeli Defense Forces confirmed the deaths of two soldiers in the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, along with the targeting of a senior Hamas commander and his deputy. Internationally, the U.S. National Security Advisor has indicated further attacks, while Denmark has joined the U.S.-led Red Sea defense coalition. Domestically, Israel has approved a budget that strengthens the IDF and provides support for evacuees and the war effort. A proposed law aims to fully fund university degrees for discharged soldiers. Protests have occurred, including one in support of Jewish students facing antisemitism at Howard University, and another in Jordan expressing solidarity with Gaza. The humanitarian situation is dire, with reports of Palestinian casualties and injuries, as well as the entry of aid convoys into Gaza.
