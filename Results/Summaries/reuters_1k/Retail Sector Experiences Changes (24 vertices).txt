The retail industry is experiencing significant changes and financial adjustments. C.O.M.B. Co sold three of its stores in Omaha as part of its restructuring plans, aiming to optimize its operations. K Mart Corporation achieved record net earnings in fiscal 1986, attributing this success to enhanced merchandising, store improvements, and cost management. However, Jewelmasters Inc faced challenges, expecting lower net income due to poor sales and increased expenses. K Mart Corp decided to retain and operate its remaining Kresge stores, which are profitable. Mrs. Fields Inc, a U.S.-based specialty food retailer, is expanding its business by opening new stores in the U.S. and focusing on existing international markets, aiming to capitalize on its success and meet consumer demands. These developments highlight the retail industry's adaptability and strategic decision-making in response to market dynamics and growth opportunities.
