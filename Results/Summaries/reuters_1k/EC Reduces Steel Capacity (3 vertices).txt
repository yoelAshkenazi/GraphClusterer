The European Community is facing significant challenges in the steel and zinc industries, with a primary focus on aligning production capacity with market demand. EC industry ministers have agreed on a voluntary closure plan for steel plants, formulated by Eurofer, which is expected to result in a substantial job loss of around 22,000 and affect 15.26 million tonnes of annual capacity. This strategy aims to address the imbalance between production and weak demand, but further capacity reductions are deemed necessary, with Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes highlighting the need to eliminate an excess of 30 million tonnes of capacity by the end of 1990. Zinc producers are also exploring voluntary closures to reduce smelting capacity, a concept that was initially proposed in 1983 but not implemented due to improved market conditions. The EC Commission is actively engaging with these producers to ensure that any proposed plans comply with European Community competition rules. The distribution of closures and funding among EC member states is a complex issue, with disagreements on how to share the burden equitably. There are ongoing discussions about the production quota system, which currently protects EC steelmakers from full competition for 65% of their products.
