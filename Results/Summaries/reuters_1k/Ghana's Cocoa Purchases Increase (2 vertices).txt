Ghana's cocoa purchases have shown a slight decline in the 23rd week of the 1986/87 main crop season, with 456 tonnes purchased compared to the previous week's 684 tonnes. However, this amount is still higher than the 1985/86 season, where 784 tonnes were purchased during the same period. Ghana Cocoa Board has reported cumulative purchases of 217,235 tonnes so far this season, outpacing the 203,884 tonnes purchased by the same week in the previous season. The International Cocoa Organization has estimated a global cocoa surplus of 94,000 tonnes for the 1986/87 season, down from the 118,000 tonnes surplus in the 1985/86 season. These figures highlight the fluctuating nature of the cocoa market and production, with Ghana's increased purchases potentially indicating a positive trend in the industry.
