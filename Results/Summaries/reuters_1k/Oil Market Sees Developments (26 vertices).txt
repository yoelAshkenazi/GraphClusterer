The energy sector is experiencing significant developments, with the International Energy Agency predicting a slowdown in oil demand growth within OECD countries, primarily driven by transport fuels. This deceleration is expected to reach around one percent in 1987, compared to 2.3 percent in 1986, however, consumer prices may influence the pace of this trend. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto anticipates a bullish trend in the oil market, with prices stabilizing around $18 per barrel and underlying demand expected to rise later in the year. Japanese companies are refraining from renewing term contracts for Iranian crude due to the gap between spot and OPEC prices, which could prompt Iran to offer discounts on April cargoes. Malaysia's state oil company, Petronas, is further reducing its oil production by 17.5% from the 1986 target to support OPEC's efforts to boost prices. Saudi Arabia is committed to the December agreement among OPEC members to stabilize oil prices at $18 per barrel, and the kingdom is producing below its OPEC quota, contributing to a rise in world oil prices. Conoco has increased crude oil prices by up to $1 per barrel, and Southland has raised its contract price for all grades of crude oil by $1 per barrel, reflecting the ongoing dynamics in the energy sector.
