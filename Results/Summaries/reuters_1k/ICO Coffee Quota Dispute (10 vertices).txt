The global coffee market is facing significant challenges due to the failure to reach an agreement on coffee export quotas, causing economic repercussions for major players like Brazil and Colombia. Brazil has taken measures to strengthen its trade balance, including temporarily legalizing the purchase of US dollars in the parallel currency market to facilitate the import of foreign goods. This move aims to alleviate the impact of the inability to set export quotas, which has resulted in a sharp decline in international coffee prices. A disagreement between Brazil and the US over the criteria for setting export quotas was the primary cause of the breakdown, with Brazil arguing that consumers were dictating quotas rather than negotiating them. The situation has raised concerns about potential market instability, with coffee trade sources predicting a massive selloff in London coffee futures and a price war among coffee roasters. The US and Brazil have exchanged accusations regarding the breakdown of talks, with the US blaming Brazil's unwillingness to negotiate based on objective criteria, while Brazil claims consumers dictated the quotas. The expected drop in coffee prices could lead to supermarket price reductions and significant losses for coffee-producing nations, particularly those in Africa and Colombia, who may face up to $3 billion in annual losses. Brazil has adopted a flexible policy approach, emphasizing its ability to sell coffee without relying on an agreement, and is seeking to increase its steel exports to the US, while reconsidering its coffee export targets to maintain flexibility and adjust to market conditions.
