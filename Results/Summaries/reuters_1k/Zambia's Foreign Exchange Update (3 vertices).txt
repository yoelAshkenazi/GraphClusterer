The Bank of Zambia has made progress in clearing its foreign exchange arrears, settling three auctions but with four still outstanding, amounting to $8 million. Zambia's financial negotiations with the World Bank and IMF have faced challenges related to food subsidies and the stabilization of the kwacha. The Zambian government suspended weekly auctions in January to introduce a modified system following discussions with the World Bank and IMF, with President Kaunda confirming that auctions will continue for private sector bidders but will not influence the kwacha's exchange rate. The naira appreciated against the dollar in Nigeria's latest auction, where stricter enforcement of documentation requirements led to the disqualification of 17 banks, resulting in the Central Bank of Nigeria selling only $38.39 million out of the $50 million offered, highlighting the Central Bank's focus on ensuring proper documentation for foreign exchange transactions. Discussions between Zambia and international financial institutions aim to address the country's economic challenges, with a focus on the currency's stability and subsidy management, while Nigeria's currency auction demonstrates a commitment to a robust and transparent foreign exchange market.
