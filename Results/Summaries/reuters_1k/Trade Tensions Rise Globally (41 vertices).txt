Japan, the United States, and the European Community are engaged in various trade-related issues and negotiations, with Japan and the US facing the most significant tensions. The Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are concerned about the rising value of the yen and its potential impact on the economy. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has asked trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, as the excessive rise in the yen could have unfavorable effects on the economy. Japan and the US are experiencing trade friction due to Japan's large trade surplus, which reached 8.14 billion dollars in March. The US has announced plans to impose tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the possibility of a trade war. The EC and the Soviet-led Comecon have failed to reach a trade agreement due to disagreements over West Berlin's status. The EC and Japan are also experiencing trade tensions, with the EC criticizing Japan's trade imbalance and the US considering tariffs on Japanese electronics. The upcoming talks between leading industrial nations will focus on currency stability and economic growth, and there are concerns about a serious trade conflict between the US and Japan, as well as tensions between the EC and Japan, which could impact other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japan's Agriculture Minister will meet with the US Agriculture Secretary to discuss bilateral farm trade issues, including trade in beef, oranges, and import controls on farm products. The US is also engaged in trade negotiations with other countries, such as Canada, where the US has threatened to file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Canada's decision to impose duties on US corn imports. The trade-related issues and negotiations between Japan, the US, and the EC are complex and multifaceted, with various factors contributing to tensions and potential conflicts.
