Several companies have recently announced their quarterly dividend payouts, with some maintaining consistent rates from the previous quarter. MCA INC will pay a dividend of 17 cents per share on April 13th, while Federal Paper Board Co will distribute a similar amount of 17.25 cents per share on April 15th. Super Rite Foods Inc is also keeping its dividend steady at five cents per share, with a payment date of April 27th. MCM Corp has postponed its financial reporting for the fourth quarter and year-end due to potential liability issues at its subsidiary, Occidental Fire and Casualty Co, which recently paid $26 million to Mutual of Omaha but may have liabilities exceeding this amount, with an assessment expected by mid-April.
