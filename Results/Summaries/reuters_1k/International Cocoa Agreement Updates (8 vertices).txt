The International Cocoa Organization is implementing a buffer stock system to stabilize cocoa prices, but faces challenges due to market skepticism and the current cocoa surplus. The system aims to counter the surplus and the existing carryover of 100,000 tonnes, but its effectiveness is questioned by market participants. The agreed buffer stock rules include a trading system with fixed differentials for cocoa from various origins, limiting the impact of non-member purchases and regulating buying and selling operations. Japan's impending membership will expand the organization's influence, while a draft proposal suggests an offer system for cocoa purchases, limits on non-member cocoa, and a pricing system with differentials for various cocoa grades. Consumer members have accepted the proposal, but producers have yet to respond, leaving the market in anticipation. Traders are cautiously optimistic, but uncertain about the final agreement and its potential impact on prices. The recent price increase is attributed to sterling's rally against the dollar, attracting origin selling. The new International Cocoa Agreement is expected to stabilize prices, benefiting producer countries and promoting international economic equilibrium.
