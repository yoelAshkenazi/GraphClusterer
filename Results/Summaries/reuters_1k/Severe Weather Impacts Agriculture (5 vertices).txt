Severe weather has brought a mix of challenges and minimal risks to agriculture and transportation across the United States and beyond. Cold temperatures have halted wheat growth, prevented field work, and caused cattle losses in Oklahoma, where high topsoil and subsoil moisture levels are present. Texas cotton crops are relatively safe from the cold as planting has not started in major cotton-producing regions. A blizzard in Istanbul has caused significant disruptions, halting shipping through the Bosphorus and closing the airport, while strong winds and high seas have shut down Alexandria's port and an oil pipeline terminal in Egypt. A powerful winter storm, centered over north-central Oklahoma, is creating hazardous conditions across the Plains, Midwest, and South, bringing heavy snowfall and rain, accompanied by high winds that are causing blizzard-like conditions and prompting various travel advisories and warnings, and is expected to continue moving north, impacting additional regions.
