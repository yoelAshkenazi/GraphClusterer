Braniff Inc. and Goldfield Corp. recently announced their financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, revealing contrasting performances. Braniff's fourth-quarter report showed a net loss of $4.5 million, a significant increase from the previous year's $1.5 million loss, primarily due to a revenue decline and higher losses per share. Despite this, Braniff's 1986 net results benefited from an extraordinary gain related to tax loss carryforward. In contrast, Goldfield Corp. reported a net loss for the quarter, but demonstrated improvement with a reduced net loss and slightly higher revenues compared to the previous year. However, the full-year results diverged significantly, with Goldfield turning a profit and reversing its previous year's loss, while Braniff's losses widened, highlighting the differing fortunes of the two companies, with Goldfield's recovery efforts showing positive results, while Braniff continues to face financial challenges.
