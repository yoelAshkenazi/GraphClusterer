Three companies are planning stock splits, a strategy often employed to boost shareholder value and attract investors. The Toronto Sun Publishing Corporation is set to double its shares through a two-for-one split, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Similarly, Northern Telecom is proposing a two-for-one stock split, aiming to increase the number of shares available. TCBY Enterprises, a frozen yogurt retailer, has taken a slightly different approach with a three-for-two stock split, increasing its outstanding shares from 17.3 million to over 26 million. These moves suggest that the companies are considering growth and expansion, making their shares more accessible to a wider range of investors.
