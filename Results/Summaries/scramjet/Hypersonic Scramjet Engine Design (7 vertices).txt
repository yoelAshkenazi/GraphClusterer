Scramjet technology, a type of air-breathing engine designed for hypersonic flight with Mach numbers greater than 5 or 6, encompasses various aspects. The fundamentals of turbulent supersonic combustion include the physics of combustion in supersonic flows, Navier-Stokes equations, kinetic schemes, and different computational approaches like RANS/URANS and LES, which highlight challenges in resolving closure problems for reaction rates and introduce models to account for turbulence-chemistry interactions. The design and optimization of scramjet intake systems emphasize the importance of shock wave interactions and pressure losses, with a novel design featuring specific fin angles and entrance widths that enhances combustion efficiency. A computer simulation method develops 3D and 1D mathematical models of scramjet components, particularly focusing on the combustor cooling system to optimize engine performance based on different fuels. A numerical study improves scramjet intake performance by modifying the leading edge of the ramp, reducing flow separation, and enhancing pressure recovery. A new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations uses a hybrid model closure with a reaction-rate approach, tested on a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor, showing the significance of composition fluctuations, especially near the injection point.
