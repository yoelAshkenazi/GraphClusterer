dual-mode ramjet components design and hypersonic airbreathing vehicle system studies.\n On this base, the present activity, led in cooperation with ONERA, is mainly focused on the development of the dual mode ramjet technology (Ref[1] and [2]).\n From the point of view of materials, the major technological difficulty for the development of hypersonic airbreathing vehicles, powered by dualmode ramjet or scramjet, is to design and realize the structure of the combustion chamber.\n Indeed, the combustion chamber and the fuel injection and\u002for flame stabilization systems, possibly placed in the flow, must be able to sustain a rarely so severe thermomechanical environment.\n Moreover, it is possible that the operational use of the airbreathing propulsion on a very large range of Mach number (Mach 2 to Mach 8 for military application, at least Mach 2 to Mach 10 for space launcher application) will imply a variable geometry for the combustion chamber.\n It supposes to have on disposal structures with sufficiently controlled geometry to ensure tightness between movable and fixed surfaces of the chamber.\n By another way, working at high wall temperature limits the thermal loading, particularly during a high-speed cruise phase.\n That is very favorable for military application if we consider the limited cooling capacity of a hydrocarbon fuel even if it is endothermic.\n That is also very favorable for space launcher application (with hydrogen as fuel) for extending at the maximum the use of the installed airbreathing propulsion system.\n Finally, having large design margin allows to use relatively low cost cooling systems while ensuring good reliability and safety characteristics. c)2001 American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics or Published with

Missiles (EADS-AMM) has been a major contributor, beside ONERA, to the National Research and Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion PREPHA (Ref[1]).\n Within the scope of this program, EADS-AMM acquired a first know-how in scramjet and dual-mode ramjet components design and hypersonic airbreathing vehicle system studies.\n On this base, the present activity, led in cooperation with ONERA, is mainly focused on the development of the dual mode ramjet technology (Ref[1] and [2]).\n From the point of view of materials, the major technological difficulty for the development of hypersonic airbreathing vehicles, powered by dualmode ramjet or scramjet, is to design and realize the structure of the combustion chamber.\n Indeed, the combustion chamber and the fuel injection and\u002for flame stabilization systems, possibly placed in the flow, must be able to sustain a rarely so severe thermomechanical environment.\n Moreover, it is possible that the operational use of the airbreathing propulsion on a very large range of Mach number (Mach 2 to Mach 8 for military application, at least Mach 2 to Mach 10 for space launcher application) will imply a variable geometry for the combustion chamber.\n It supposes to have on disposal structures with sufficiently controlled geometry to ensure tightness between movable and fixed surfaces of the chamber.\n By another way, working at high wall temperature limits the thermal loading, particularly during a high-speed cruise phase.\n That is very favorable for military application if we consider the limited cooling capacity of a hydrocarbon fuel even if it is endothermic.\n That is also very favorable for space launcher application (with hydrogen as fuel) for extending at the maximum the use of the installed airbreathing propulsion system.\n Finally, having large design margin allows to use relatively low cost cooling systems while ensuring good reliability and safety characteristics. c)2001 American
