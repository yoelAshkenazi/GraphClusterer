Broadcasting Co. stock experienced a rise of almost three points following a proposal from its vice chairman and an investment group to increase their takeover bid for the company.\n The group, led by Dudley Taft and Narragansett Capital Inc., expressed their commitment to acquiring the broadcast company and their willingness to negotiate a transaction exceeding $150 per share.\n However, the company's response indicated that no decisions regarding a sale have been made yet.\n The stock's surge has led to speculation about a potential bidding war, with prominent shareholders like Robert Bass and Carl Lindner holding significant stakes.\n Some arbitragers believe the stock is a risky buy at current levels due to uncertainties surrounding the bidding process and regulatory approvals.\n Taft previously rejected a $145 per share bid from the investment group, and analysts have speculated about the potential for a leveraged buyout or a breakup of the company to satisfy various interests.\n"],["SENIOR ENGINEERING MAKES 12.5 MLN DLR US PURCHASE\n  &lt;Senior Engineering Group Plc\u003e said it\n  reached agreement with &lt;Cronus Industries Inc\u003e to acquire the\n  whole

two-year call option for Gulf Canada to sell its stake and a put option for Allied-Lyons to buy it.\n Holden-Brown, Allied-Lyons' chairman, stated that Gulf Canada could potentially sell part of its stake in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent.\n Allied-Lyons maintains control of the board and management of Hiram Walker-Gooderham and expects a substantial profit contribution from the distiller.\n The company financed the acquisition with cash and borrowings and has no plans for a stock issue, but they are evaluating potential acquisitions in the Canadian market, excluding breweries.\n Allied-Lyons also intends to list its shares on Canadian stock exchanges later this year.\n"],["NESTLE TO ACQUIRE NABISCO CANADA BUSINESSES\n  Swiss-based &lt;Nestle S.A.\u003e's Nestle\n

prices and support the rubber industry, growers and traders are concerned that the buffer stock mechanism will interfere with free market forces and prevent rubber prices from rising sharply.\n The new INRA, which replaces the current agreement expiring on October 22, aims to maintain price stability through its buffer stock system.\n Malaysian officials are optimistic about the new agreement and believe it will prevent a potential depression in prices, while Indonesian and Thai officials also see benefits in price stabilization and improved financial provisions.\n However, Malaysian growers and traders prefer a free market without the influence of a large INRA buffer stock, which they believe limits price increases.\n Traders in the region also worry that the new pact might pressure prices in the long term as increased production could result from the pact's price stabilization potential.\n Overall, the new INRA has generated differing opinions among Asian stakeholders, with some favoring its price stabilization measures and others expressing concerns about its impact on the free market and potential limitations on price increases.\n"],["U.K.\n VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT
