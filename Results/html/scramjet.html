main reason for the combustion enhancement of the H2\u2013air mixture in the scramjet duct is the intensification of chain-branching reactions due to the injection of a small amount of cold non-equilibrium oxygen plasma comprising highly reactive species, O2(a 1\u0394g) and molecules and O atoms, into the H2\u2013air supersonic flow.\n",false,47,"A comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of an approach based on the injection of a thin oxygen stream, subjected to a tailored electric discharge, into a supersonic H2\u2013air flow to enhance the combustion performance in the mixing layer and in the scramjet combustor is conducted.\n It is shown that for such an approach there exist optimal values of reduced electric field E\u002fN and transversal dimension d of the injected oxygen stream, which provide the minimal length of induction zone in the mixing layer.\n The optimal values of E\u002fN and d depend on air flow parameters and the specific energy put into the oxygen.\n The injection of a thin oxygen stream (d = 1 mm) subjected to an electric discharge with E\u002fN = 50\u2013100 Td, which produces mostly singlet oxygen O2(a 1\u0394g) and molecules and

realized in the same flowpath using the thermal choking approach, and the dual-mode scramjet combustor has attracted an increasing attention.\n The ram-to-scram mode transition mechanism in a strut-based dual-mode scramjet combustor has been evaluated numerically, and the influences of the inlet boundary conditions at the entrance of the isolator, the injection strategy and the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio on the mode transition have been investigated.\n At the same time, the numerical approach has been validated through a turbulent diffusion combustion problem, as well as the effectiveness of the hydrogen-air chemical reaction mechanism.\n The obtained results show that the inlet boundary conditions at the entrance of the isolator and the jet-to-crossflow pressure ratio both have a large impact on the ram-to-scram mode transition, and the flow upstream of the strut is subsonic when the jet-to-crossflow pressure is large enough, namely 10.0 and 15.0 in the current study.\n The thermal choking point first appears at the leading edge of the strut, namely nearly at x = 0.25 m.\n The low freestream Mach number is beneficial for the ramjet mode operation, and the engine would convert into the scramjet mode with the increase of the flight velocity of the vehicle.\n The influence of the injection strategy employed in this paper can be neglected, and the Mach number distribution upstream of the leading edge of the strut has not been disturbed.\n",false,48,"The ramjet and scramjet modes can be realized in the same flowpath using the thermal choking
