printing.\n"]],"hoverinfo":"text","marker":{"color":["#1f78b4","#ffcc00","#ffcc00","#ffcc00","#ffcc00","#ffcc00","#ffcc00","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4","#1f78b4"],"line":{"color":"#333","width":2},"size":[30,40,40,40,40,40,40,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30],"sizemode":"diameter","symbol":["circle","star","star","star","star","star","star","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle","circle"]},"mode":"markers+text","name":"Nodes","text":["1","3D
