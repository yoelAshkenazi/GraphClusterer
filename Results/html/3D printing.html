anatomy is crucial in the assessment of MV disease.\n While the use of three-dimensional (3D) modelling and printing in MV assessment has undergone early clinical evaluation, the precision and usefulness of this technology requires further investigation.\n This study aimed to assess and validate 3D modelling and printing technology to produce patient-specific 3D MV models.\n A prototype method for MV 3D modelling and printing was developed from computed tomography (CT) scans of a plastinated human heart.\n Mitral valve models were printed using four 3D printing methods and validated to assess precision.\n Cardiac CT and 3D echocardiography imaging data of four MV disease patients was used to produce patient-specific 3D printed models, and 40 cardiac health professionals (CHPs) were surveyed on the perceived value and potential uses of 3D models in a clinical setting.\n The prototype method demonstrated submillimetre precision for all four 3D printing methods used, and statistical analysis showed a significant difference (p \u003c 0.05) in precision between these methods.\n Patient-specific 3D printed models, particularly using multiple print materials, were considered useful by CHPs for preoperative planning, as well as other applications such as teaching and training.\n This study suggests that, with further advances in 3D modelling and printing

printed structures.\n The principle of FDM is piling up melted printing material (mainly resin material).\n And crevice of each layer generates layer grooves.\n The layer grooves make the 3D printed structures mechanical characteristics deteriorate.\n For example, friction and strength.\n Currently 3D printing technology are not able to control the 3D printed structures to have constant friction and strength value.\n The 3D printed Structures are difficult to use for mechanical parts.\n Therefore authors already devised the 3D-CMF (Chemical Melting Finishing).\n The 3D-CMF is the method that dissolve the convex part of the layer grooves and filled in the concave part of the layer grooves and smoothen the layer grooves.\n The 3D-CMF changes the surface statement of the 3D printed structures, which is considered to affect the coefficient of friction.\n In this paper, we investigated the fundamental characteristics of the 3D-CMF and demonstrate of the change of the coefficient of static friction of the 3D printed structures.\n"],["We present a software that provides 3D model modification functions based on the content-awareness for mobile devices.\n The integrity of the 3D

micro-computed tomography (CT) images were acquired and the portions with the fractured bones were extracted by segmentation and reconstruction using image preprocessing software.\n Based on this, 3D modeling of the fracture site scaffold was performed, and the 3D printing protocol was experimentally verified through polylactic acid (PLA)-based 3D printing and implantation at the fracture site.\n The entire process of making the fracture model, manufacturing the customized 3D-printed bone fragment, and implanting it in the defect site was performed based on 3D printing.\n There is a need for further animal clinical validation and histological studies on the fracture recovery process according to 3D printing protocols.\n Nevertheless, this approach (performing the implantation process of a customizable 3D printing scaffold for replacing atypical fractures using X-ray and micro-CT images) is expected to play a new role in fracture treatment.\n"],["Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is an
