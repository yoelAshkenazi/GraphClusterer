the interpretation of the Law in the context of Jesus' teachings and Paul's writings.\n Jesus emphasizes the importance of the Law, stating that not even the smallest detail will pass away until everything is accomplished.\n He highlights the need for righteousness beyond that of the religious leaders of the time.\n However, the Law was primarily binding on Jews and not Gentiles, which the Church had to address after Jesus' death.\n Paul, on the other hand, suggests that the Law's purpose is to convict people of their sinfulness, but it has been superceded by Christ.\n He focuses on moral standards rather than ceremonial laws like circumcision and the Sabbath.\n While Jesus and Paul may seem to have differing views on the Law, they are actually discussing different aspects of it.\n Jesus commends the Law's broader implications for morals and human relationships, while Paul addresses specific Jewish ceremonial practices.\n Ultimately, both Jesus and Paul acknowledge the

presents FBI and Scotland Yard statistics showing that the US has a significantly higher rate of handgun-related deaths than the UK, even when adjusted for population differences.\n The text also highlights a study of violence in Chicago, which found that gun homicides are more frequent than knife homicides, and that most gun homicides are committed in moments of rage rather than with a focused intent to kill.\n\n\nThe study then shifts to a comparison between Seattle and Vancouver, two cities with similar populations, economies, and crime rates but different approaches to gun control.\n Seattle allows for legal handgun purchase and concealed carry, while Vancouver has stricter regulations.\n The study found that the rate of robbery, burglary, and assault in both cities was nearly identical, but Seattle had a significantly higher rate of firearm-related homicides.\n The text concludes that limited legal access to handguns does have an impact on homicide rates, and that

discrimination against atheists, Sunday trading laws, the Satanic Child Abuse myth, and the dangers of religion to society and the individual.\n It also addresses the issue of Hitler's atheism, stating that he was not an atheist and had made statements supporting the existence of God.\n\n\nThe FAQ addresses the Bible's accuracy and the argument that it proves the existence of God, stating that many readers of the newsgroup feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy and that any claimed 'truth' must be examined before being accepted.\n It also discusses Pascal's Wager, a philosophical argument for believing in God, and its flaws, including the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem and the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely.\n\n\nThe document also covers Occam's Razor, a principle that suggests taking the simplest solution when explaining something, and its relevance to atheism.\n It discusses the complexity of the universe and the possibility of a causeless cause, as well as the Argument From Design, which claims that the presence of design in the universe proves the existence of God.\n\n\nThe FAQ addresses the issue of independent evidence for the Bible's truth, the incompleteness of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, George Bush's views on atheism and patriotism, the location of Hell, and the religious nature of the USA.\n It

summary:\n\nCTX 14\": Nasty, low quality.\n Avoid.\n\n\nCTX 15\" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.\n\n  Main problem seems poor quality control.\n Some reported pincushioning\n  (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.\n\n\nI complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay\nshipping) and returned to me in 2 days.\n \n\nIt's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel\ndistortion at all.\n I'm very happy with it, and the digital\ncontrols and mode memory are nice.\n Certainly, a Trinitron\n(say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.\n\n\nConclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to\nsend it back if it's not perfect.\n It probably won't be when you get it,\nbut has good potential.\n"],["The following is a summary of the text:\n\n- The text describes a complex scenario involving multiple variables and parameters, such as 56.91, 12.3, 56.3, 57.3, 1.2, 57.2, 56.4, 57.4,

be controlled\nshooting.\n\n\n\nSome people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating\nfood that they have harvested themselves.\n  The pleasure derived from\nhunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables\ngrown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much \nfreer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or\nthe supermarket).\n\n\n\nBy \"cannot now be justified\" I guess you mean that you personally\ndon't see any justification.\n  Fine--but what makes your opinion\nso important?\n\n\nCertainly the last point is correct.\n  If politicians don't see any\nvotes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing\nand supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the \nincidence of
