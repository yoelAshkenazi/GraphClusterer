SECURITY PROPOSAL\n\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\nmillions of Americans.\n  The first part of the plan is to begin a\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n\n\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.\n  Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.\n  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.\n  Two separate escrow agents would\nstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\npresentation of a valid warrant.\n  The encryption scheme used is to be\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\nincorporation into its communications products.\n\n\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\n\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\ninquiry.\n  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\nproduct.\n Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\n\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\nthe Clipper or any other chips.\n  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n\n\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested.\n Yet, the\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.\n  EFF\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.\n  The\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.\n  \n\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\nadopted.\n  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\nanswer.\n\n\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\nand security.\n  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\ndiscussion even begins.\n\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\nhold 40-bits of each key.\n  The manufacturer of the communications device\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\nagents.\n  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n\n\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.\n  According to\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.\n  Some in the Administration\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by

effect the privacy and security of\nmillions of Americans.\n  The first part of the plan is to begin a\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\n\n\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.\n  Apparently, the\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\nNational Security Agency.\n  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\nmanufactured by a military contractor.\n  Two separate escrow agents would\nstore users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\npresentation of a valid warrant.\n  The encryption scheme used is to be\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\nincorporation into its communications products.\n\n\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\n\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\ninquiry.\n  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\nproduct.\n Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\n\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\nthe Clipper or any other chips.\n  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\n\n\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested.\n Yet, the\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.\n  EFF\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.\n  The\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.\n  \n\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\nadopted.\n  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\nanswer.\n\n\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\nand security.\n  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\ndiscussion even begins.\n\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\nhold 40-bits of each key.\n  The manufacturer of the communications device\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\nagents.\n  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\n\n\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.\n  According to\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.\n  Some in the Administration\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\n\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\nback doors to this classified algorithm.\n  In order to prove this,\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\nalgorithm for trap doors.\n  The results of the investigation would then be\nmade public.\n\n\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.\n  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\nabout four years.\n  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\n\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\nfor this product.\n  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\nGore, and maybe even the President.\n  At today's Commerce Department press\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\n\nThe Administration has also announced that it is

faster than\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.\n  \n\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\n\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\n  suspect it will\", he added.\n\n\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.\n  It's \n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.\n  Under the terms of this law,\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \n  cards.\n  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\n  one card every month.\n  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\n  further manufacture\u002fimportation or sale in this country, except to the\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\n\n\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.\n  When the\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.\n  In addition,\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\n  this program,

some\nfractions, but still very small).\n  Massive amounts of regolith would\nhave to be processed.\n\n\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.\n  As I recall, Wingo wasn't\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06\u002fpound.\n\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\n\n\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \"high-Ti\" basalts (Apollo 11\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).\n  This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.\n  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).\n  These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).\n  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.\n  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\nmined today).\n"],["Ok I want to get a color Mac I don't care if it is an LC or a Mac II or\nwhat but I want to go to a color machine.\n  I'd prefer to trade my\npresent Mac SE system plus some cash or

flipped, no decryption of the data is possible \"\nDB\t\"                                                       \"\nDB\t\" After the gas is let to evolve for 256 timesteps,     \"\nDB\t\" one can either run the reverse evolution by pressing  \"\nDB\t\" space, or flip a bit and then run by pressing '0'     \"\nDB\t\"                                                       \"\nDB\t\" For a

(Although you have a valiant attempt later at\nstating why you believe it is).\n\n \nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\n\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\nas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\npassages are complimentary.\n  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels.\n Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\n\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts.\n However, this is not the case at\nall.\n\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact.\n The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself.\n This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white.\n Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\n\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom.\n After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\n\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation.\n This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.\n  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\n\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\n It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\n\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\n\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head.\n He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\n\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building.\n In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas.\n It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.\n  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\n\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n \n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.\n  But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's.\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\nthe passages.\n  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.\n  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n\n \nDB...\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.\n  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.\n  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.\n  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.\n  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.\n  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.\n  I am not all that familiar with them.\n  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.\n  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\n\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.\n  A boy (age 14) hung himself.\n  But\nhe lived.\n  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n\n \nDB...\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nThank you, Dave.\n\n \nDB...\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?

(Although you have a valiant attempt later at\nstating why you believe it is).\n\n \nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\n\n \nDB...\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\nas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\npassages are complimentary.\n  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's\nexplanation of Judas' death...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\n=============================================================\n \nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\nconstantly confronted in our travels.\n Many people point to the apparent\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\n\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts.\n However, this is not the case at\nall.\n\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\nwas crushed by the impact.\n The two statements are indeed different, but do\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\nJudas did not hang himself.\n This is not a matter of one person calling\nsomething black and the other person calling it white.\n Both accounts can be\ntrue and supplementary.\n\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom.\n After he hung there\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\n\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\nexplanation.\n This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.\n  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\n\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\n\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\n It is important to remember that we are\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\n\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\n\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\npistol at his head.\n He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\nthe same time.\n\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\nform the tall building.\n In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\ncase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas.\n It is merely a\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\ninerrancy.\n  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\n\nHere's what you said in an earlier post...\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\n \n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.\n  But you seem to\nfind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\nJoslin's.\"\n \n_____________________________________________________________________\n \nHere, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\nthe passages.\n  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.\n  You can say\nit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it\ndidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\n\n \nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\nin this respect.\n\n \nDB...\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\n \n \nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.\n  First I would point out\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.\n  In fact it is a\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.\n  Today, I got a\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\nis on crack.\n  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a\nlocal hospital.\n  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\n\n \nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\n \n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\nResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\nterms that you use.\n  I am not all that familiar with them.\n  The man on the BAM\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.\n  It was interesting]\n \nDB...\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nQualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention\nbelow.\n\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.\n  A boy (age 14) hung himself.\n  But\nhe lived.\n  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\ndiscover.\n\n \nDB...\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\n \nMY REPLY...\n\nThank you, Dave.\n\n \nDB...\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\n \nMY REPLY...\n[^^^ above, mine]\nSo it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?

posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.\n  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.\n  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.\n  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans.\n Ralph Mannheim.\n\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.\n  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.\n  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.\n  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.\n  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell.\n Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.\n  It has several flaws.\n\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.\n  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.\n  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.\n  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.\n  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.\n  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.\n  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.\n  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1.\n One does not know whether God exists.\n  2.\n Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3.\n Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4.\n Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.\n  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.\n  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.\n  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.\n  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.\n  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.\n  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption.\n The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.\n  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.\n  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.\n  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1.\n There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2.\n There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.\n  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\n\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3.\n There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.\n  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.\n  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.\n  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.\n  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.\n  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\".\n \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.\n  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory.\n Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.\n  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.\n  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.\n  In\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.\n  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.\n  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.\n  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.\n  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.\n  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.\n  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.\n  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.\n  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.\n  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.\n  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.\n  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse.\n Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\n\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism.\n Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.\n  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.\n  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.\n  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.\n  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.\n  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.\n  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.\n  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.\n  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.\n  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.\n  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.\n  For example...\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.\n  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.\n  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).\n  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.\n  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.\n \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.\n  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.\n  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.\n  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable.\n Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\n\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988.\n Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.\n  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.\n  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.\n  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.\n  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.\n  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.\n  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr.\n Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.\n  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr.\n Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).\n  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.\n  On February 21st 1989, C.\n Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!

posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.\n  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.\n  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.\n  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator:

believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.\n  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.\n  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.\n  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.\n  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell.\n Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.\n  It has several flaws.\n\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.\n  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.\n  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.\n  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.\n  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.\n  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.\n  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.\n  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1.\n One does not know whether God exists.\n  2.\n Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3.\n Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4.\n Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.\n  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.\n  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.\n  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.\n  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.\n  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.\n  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption.\n The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.\n  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.\n  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.\n  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1.\n There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2.\n There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.\n  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\n\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3.\n There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.\n  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.\n  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.\n  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do

believed in God.\n  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\".\n \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.\n  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory.\n Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.\n  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.\n  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.\n  In\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.\n  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.\n  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.\n  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.\n  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.\n  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.\n  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.\n  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.\n  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.\n  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.\n  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.\n  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse.\n Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\n\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism.\n Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.\n  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.\n  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.\n  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.\n  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.\n  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.\n  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.\n  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.\n  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.\n  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.\n  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.\n  For example...\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.\n  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.\n  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).\n  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.\n  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.\n \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.\n  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.\n  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.\n  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable.\n Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\n\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988.\n Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.\n  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.\n  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.\n  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.\n  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.\n  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.\n  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr.\n Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.\n  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr.\n Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).\n  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.\n  On February 21st 1989, C.\n Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!

some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.\n  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries.\n A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not.\"\n      - James Madison, \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\", 1785\n\n  \"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  \"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.\n  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose.\"\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  \"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it.\"\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from \"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.\n  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans' \"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S.\n Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.\n  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.\n  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\n\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n\n"],["\nBuffalo seems to have started a tradition

People \n-\u003egathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing \n-\u003esomeone who was or had been healed.\n  Call me a fool, but I believe he did \n-\u003eheal people.\n  \n\n\nLogic alert -  argument from incredulity.\n  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't\nmean that it isn't true.\n  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.\n\nHe has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.\n\nBy not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what \nhe believes.\n  As far as healing goes.\n  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\nconsistent between the different gospels.\n  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \nthat faith healers can pull off today.\n  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\n\n-\u003e\tNiether was he a lunatic.\n  Would more than an entire nation be drawn \n-\u003eto someone who was crazy.\n  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.\n  For example \n-\u003eanyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \n-\u003ethis right away.\n-\u003e\tTherefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \n-\u003ereal thing.\n  \n\n\nOr might not have existed, or any number of things.\n  That is the logical pitfall that those who\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.\n  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \npossible.\n  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\nall other possible alternatives.\n\n\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.\n  I have given at \nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\n\n-\u003e\tSome other things to note.\n  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \n-\u003ethe psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.\n  This in his betrayal \n-\u003eand Crucifixion.\n  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \n-\u003ewrite I will use it.\n\n\nJC was a rabbi.\n  He knew what those prophecies were.\n  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.\n  What would be compeling is if there\nwere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet \nfullfilled them anyway.\n\n-\u003e\tI don't think most people understand what a Christian is.\n  It \n-\u003eis certainly not what I see a lot in churches.\n  Rather I think it \n-\u003eshould be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's \n-\u003esake.\n  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \n-\u003esame.\n  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \n-\u003eover to him.\n  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a \n-\u003ereal Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.\n  But \n-\u003ejust like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes \n-\u003etime.\n  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  \n-\u003eIt is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in \n-\u003ea while.\n  We box everything into time units.\n  Such as work at this \n-\u003etime, sports, Tv, social life.\n  God is above these boxes and should be \n-\u003ecarried with us into all these boxes that we have created for \n-\u003eourselves.\n  \n\nHere I agree with you.\n  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says \nseriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.\n  I have very little respect for \nXians that don't.\n  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.\n  The picking and choosing\nthat I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n\nJim\t  \n\n\n\n\n---\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJames L.\n Felder\t\t\t|\nSverdrup Technology,Inc.\t|     phone: 216-891-4019\nNASA Lewis Research Center     \t|    \nCleveland, Ohio  44135         \t|     email: jfelder@lerc.nasa.gov \n\"Some people drink from the fountain of knowledge, other people gargle\""],["   --Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise!!!

We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period.\n They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods.\n Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it.\n After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1\u002f2 way up on his left.\n Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone.\n Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr.\n Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18.\n It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage.\n The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while.\n The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone.\n LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play.\n Mogilny got\na post after it was over.\n The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play.\n The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot.\n Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net.\n Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck.\n Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods.\n Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged.\n This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went.\n When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money.\n But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again.\n When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season.\n He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\n\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that.\n This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\").\n Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\n\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second.\n The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did.\n Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards.\n Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle.\n He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot.\n Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway.\n He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom.\n He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\n\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22.\n The Sabres coudln't\nget started.\n Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way.\n It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman.\n Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40.\n That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time.\n Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them.\n Boos began to ring through the building.\n But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal.\n Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot.\n Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\n\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net.\n Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie.\n He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away.\n With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again.\n This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal.\n The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\n\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty.\n McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff.\n The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim.\n But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that.\n After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom.\n LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right.\n Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2.\n LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong.\n Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line.\n Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season.\n Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back.\n A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from.\n When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post.\n That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\n\nThan an incredible almost goal.\n Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom.\n Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net.\n Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers.\n But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing.\n Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck.\n Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35.\n The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all.\n They finally got set up 1\u002f2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter.\n As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle.\n Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him.\n Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\n\nBut the Sabres came right back.\n LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net.\n Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net.\n Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55.\n The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there.\n Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle.\n While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\n\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone.\n Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck.\n He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself.\n Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play.\n Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves.\n The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\n\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him.\n He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek.\n He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday.\n That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts.\n Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\n\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts.\n Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year.\n His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie

nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle.\n He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot.\n Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway.\n He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom.\n He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\n\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22.\n The Sabres coudln't\nget started.\n Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way.\n It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman.\n Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40.\n That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time.\n Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them.\n Boos began to ring through the building.\n But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal.\n Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot.\n Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\n\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net.\n Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie.\n He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away.\n With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again.\n This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal.\n The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\n\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty.\n McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff.\n The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim.\n But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that.\n After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom.\n LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right.\n Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2.\n LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong.\n Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line.\n Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season.\n Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back.\n A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from.\n When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post.\n That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\n\nThan an incredible almost goal.\n Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom.\n Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net.\n Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers.\n But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing.\n Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck.\n Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35.\n The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all.\n They finally got set up 1\u002f2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter.\n As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle.\n Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him.\n Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\n\nBut the Sabres came right back.\n LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net.\n Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net.\n Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55.\n The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there.\n Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle.\n While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\n\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone.\n Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck.\n He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself.\n Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play.\n Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves.\n The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\n\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him.\n He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek.\n He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday.\n That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts.\n Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\n\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts.\n Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year.\n His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie

...\n\n\nA 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.\n  Torque spec for the U bolt\nnuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).\n   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of\ntorque spec ...\n\n\nIt was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.\n  \nSqueeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on\nwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth\nand sixth hands ...\n  I used some string to tie the pack together\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\n\n\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and\u002for 2) rolled forward.\n\n\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\nhole.\n  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\nforward about 1\u002f2 inch to get things to line up.\n  Spent more than an\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \nit back... hmmm...).\n\n\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\n\n\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\n\nAt least it now sits level..\n\n-- \n\nE.\n Michael Smith

Holocaust\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\n\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\nanti-semitism is impossible.\n Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way.\n While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century.\n Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe.\n When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.\n  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\n\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle.\n History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred.\n Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible.\n While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich.\n The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich.\n Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod.\n From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them.\n All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'.\n Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\n\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods.\n This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\n\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD.\n A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.\n  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development.\n Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\n\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934.\n In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine.\n It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine.\n This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination.\n The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations.\n This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews.\n After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed.\n If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary.\n Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\n\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler.\n Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear.\n In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations.\n A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S.\n B.\n Beth-Zvi.\n\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist.\n It occured near the end\nof the war.\n The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany.\n Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost.\n The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis.\n A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces.\n In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944.\n His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities.\n Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see.\n As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community.\n The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class.\n They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries.\n Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat.\n In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\n\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts.\n Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\n\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process.\n What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\n\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail.\n For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends.\n No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz.\n Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions.\n His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions.\n This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations.\n At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.\n",false,215,"From: Center for Policy Research \u003ccpr\u003e\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\n\n\nZionism and the Holocaust\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\n\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\nanti-semitism is impossible.\n Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way.\n While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century.\n Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe.\n When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.\n  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\n\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle.\n History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred.\n Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible.\n While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich.\n The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich.\n Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod.\n From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them.\n All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'.\n Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\n\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods.\n This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\n\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD.\n A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.\n  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development.\n Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways -

class,\n# then the TAs taught the labs, with 20 to 30 per class.\n# \n# Tim Fogarty (FOGARTY@SIR-C.JPL.NASA.GOV)\n\nAt Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.\n\nTeaching is definitely more the goal, and sometimes, it actually happens.\n\nThe best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best \nprofessors I had at UCLA and USC.\n"],["My 1988 Toyota 4Runner has

there.\n  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.\n  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans.\n There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.\n  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.\n  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.\n  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.\n  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.\n  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.\n  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\n\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.\n  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.\n  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.\n  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\n\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.\n  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.\n  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1\u002f1\u002f80 to 12\u002f31\u002f86.\n In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 \u002f 1.11).\n  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.\n  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 \u002f\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 \u002f 1.12).\n  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\n\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.\n  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\n\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\n\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.\n  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.\n  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).\n  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.\n  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.\n  Only 13 involved firearms.\n  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.\n  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.\n  This report shows differently.\n\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.\n  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.\n  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.\n  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun

there.\n  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.\n  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans.\n There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.\n  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.\n  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.\n  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.\n  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.\n  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.\n  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\n\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.\n  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.\n  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.\n  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\n\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.\n  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.\n  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1\u002f1\u002f80 to 12\u002f31\u002f86.\n In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 \u002f 1.11).\n  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.\n  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 \u002f\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 \u002f 1.12).\n  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\n\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.\n  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\n\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\n\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.\n  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.\n  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).\n  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.\n  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.\n  Only 13 involved firearms.\n  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.\n  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.\n  This report shows differently.\n\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.\n  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.\n  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.\n  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun

In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.\n  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St.\n Cyril of Alexandria.\n  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.\n  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope.\n Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.\n   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.\n   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St.\n Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement.\n The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches.\n It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.\n   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).\n  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned.\n So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         \u002f  Nabil Ayoub

Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\n\n\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.\n  The religion of\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.\n  You\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\n\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.\n  There is some\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.\n  But, on the other hand,\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.\n  In fact, if\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.\n  At the very\nleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\nbadly.\n\n\nSchism... let's move on to schism.\n  What is it?\n\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\ncommand).\n  All schismatics are disobedient.\n  But it's a superset, so\nit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\nschismatics.\n  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with\nthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.\n\n\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\n\n\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.\n  Look in any\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\ncommand.\n\n\nHere's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\n\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\n\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.\n  They pray for him every\nday.\n  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.\n\n\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\nschism goes.\n  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\n\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\nHoly Father's motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.\n  It's the\ndefinitive document on the subject.\n  A motu proprio is a specifically\nPapal act.\n  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.\n  It's from the Pope\nhimself.\n  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.\n\n\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\n\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\nconstituted a schismatic act.\n\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\nof Tradtion.\n\n\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.\n\n\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".\n  It\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.\n  If episcopal\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\nunder the current code of canon law.\n  But my problem with this is\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.\n  It only confers the power\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.\n  Jurisdiction must be\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\nPope).\n  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\nanyone.\n  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\n\n\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.\n  According to this idea,\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.\n  I lent the article\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.\n  I believe they\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\n\n\nThe Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\n\nThere's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\ntheology.\n  So why does the Pope think this?\n\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's\nthe passage in question:\n\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.\n  Incomplete, because it does\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\n\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\n        help of the Holy Spirit.\n  There is a growth in insight into\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.\n  This comes\n        about in various ways.\n  It comes through the contemplation and\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\n\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\n        they experience.\n  And it comes from the preaching of those who\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\n\n\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.\n  It is impossible to\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\n\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\n\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\nbe simplified to the following:\n\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\n- I am the Pope.\n\n\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\n\nThis is weak, to say the least!\n\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\nArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.\n  What is John Paul II's\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\n\nI don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\n\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\n\n\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.\n  If the Pope\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\nexists.\n  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\nshortly be healed.\n  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\n\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.\n  What good will it\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\ndiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.\n  It's something else to\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\nall in his imagination.\n  That means that acts of church discipline are\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.\n  Generally\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\n\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.\n  You are now opening the door\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\n\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\nthat you say defines schism.\n",false,354,"Larry L.\n Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\n\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\n   net.\n  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.\n  But that's really beside\n   the point.\n  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\n   provided for in canon law.\n\n\nHere's some of the theology involved for the interested.\n\n\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \"schism\"; often the\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\n\n- true obedience\n- false obedience\n- disobedience\n- schism\n\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.\n  There are 2\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\n\n1) a command\n2) the response made to the command\n\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.\n  Or they can be\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\n\n\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\n\n\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\n\ncommand         response            name\n-----------------------------------------------------\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\n\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\n\n\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance\u002frefusal.\n  The nature of\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\nconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".\n  You also have to take into consideration\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\n\n\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!\n\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.\n  But that\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".\n  You\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\n\n\nAnd there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.\n  The Popes have of\ncourse disagreed.\n\n\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\n\n\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.\n  The religion of\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.\n  You\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\nin this country.

\n\n\n2:52 P.M.\n EDT\n\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, \ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \npeople, their jobs and their economic future.\n  The federal budget \nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \nand opportunity in the country.\n  \n\t     \n\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.\n  It now has the support \nof a majority of the United States Senate.\n \n\t     \n\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.\n  \nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n\n\t     \n\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.\n  The issue \nis not politics, it's people.\n  Sixteen million of them are looking \nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.\n  These men and women don't \ncare about who's up or down in Washington.\n  They care about paying \nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\n\n\t     \n\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \neconomy forward.\n  I am prepared to do that.\n  And I have been working \nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \nplan.\n  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \nnational needs.\n  \n\t     \n\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.\n  \nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \nthe American people.\n \n\t     \n\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \ndramatic rise in violent crime.\n \n\t     \n\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.\n  Together, with a \nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \ncommunities all across our nation.\n\n\t     \n\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \nAmerica can make.\n  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.\n  \n\t     \n\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.\n  Make no \nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \never have.\n  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n\n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \nrehire police officers.\n  They came here because they believe in the \nsummer jobs portion of the package.\n  And I want them to be free to \ntalk about that.\n  They came here not out of any

future.\n\n\t     \n\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \nthese communities.\n  I have always supported community policing not \nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.\n  It reduces \nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n\n\t     \n\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.\n  \nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \nyears.\n  This makes a good downpayment on that.\n  This keeps in mind \nthe core of the jobs package.\n  And this will help us to move forward.\n  \n\t     \n\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the

labor community -- \npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \nmany of those that we depend upon to

I assume summer \njobs is one.\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \nhighway program and I want the police program.\n  I still intend -- let \nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.\n  This is a \nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.\n  But I think \nwe need to do that.\n\n\t     \n\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \nwith AIDS.\n  And there are several other things that I think should be \ndone.\n  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \nsafety of the public depends on that.\n  \n\t     \n\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.\n  And Senator Dole \ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \nhim back.\n  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \ndiscussed this.\n  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \nreach some accord.\n  \n\t     \n\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\n\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.\n  When I talked to Senator \nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.\n  \nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \nAmerican people wanted us to address.\n  And this is certainly \nconsistent with that.\n\n\t     \n\t     Thank you.\n",false,375,"THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the

and gentlemen, \ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \npeople, their jobs and their economic future.\n  The federal budget \nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \nand opportunity in the country.\n  \n\t     \n\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.\n  It now has the support \nof a majority of the United States Senate.\n \n\t     \n\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.\n  \nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n\n\t     \n\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.\n  The issue \nis not politics, it's people.\n  Sixteen million of them are looking \nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.\n  These men and women don't \ncare about who's up or down in Washington.\n  They care about paying \nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\n\n\t     \n\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \neconomy forward.\n  I am prepared to do that.\n  And I have been working \nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \nplan.\n  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \nnational needs.\n  \n\t     \n\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.\n  \nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \nthe American people.\n \n\t     \n\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \ndramatic rise in violent crime.\n \n\t     \n\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.\n  Together, with a \nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \ncommunities all across our nation.\n\n\t     \n\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \nAmerica can make.\n  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.\n  \n\t     \n\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.\n  Make no \nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \never have.\n  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n\n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \nrehire police officers.\n  They came here because they believe in the \nsummer jobs portion of the package.\n  And I want them to be free to \ntalk about that.\n  They came here not out of any law enforcement \nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \na brighter and more peaceful future.\n\n\t     \n\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \nthese communities.\n  I have always supported community policing not \nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.\n  It reduces \nthe chances of abusive action by police

it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and\n shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer's top corner.\n Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure.\n Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin.\n Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3.\n Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson.\n Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed

First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot.\n Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a

best.\n\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team.\n Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n\n Stillman good on defense.\n\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though.\n Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och

Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.\n It would

therein.\n\nWhich says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my\n(or any) religion.  \"Love\" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians\ncan write both the \"gentle\" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in\na passage that even the \"conservatives\" will quote at you :-) -- and the\nwords of T.\n S.\n Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\n\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\n\n\nblechhh.\n  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.\n  Though,\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of \"sin\" on\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\n\n\n\nYou misread.\n  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\nin near succession.\n  Please go back to my quoted words above:\n\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.\n  I must also note\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.\n  By Christian\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\nprohibitions.\n\n\nWhat Mr.\n Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\n\n\tA.\n  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\n\t    in the Inquisition.\n\n\n\tB.\n  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\n\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\n\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\n\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\n\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\n\n\tA.\n  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\n\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\n\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\n\n\n\tB.\n  Burns me at the stake.\n\n\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.\n  What is\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\nbelievable if taken under torture.\n  The elimination of Inqisitorial\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\n\n\nMr.\n Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.\n  I know this; and in what-\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\nattorney.\n  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\nmay others.\n  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\nInquisitor.\n  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\nof charges brought against them.)\n\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.\n  The \"conservative\" (I don't think that\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\nthe gospel, as if one's theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\nJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf.\n Matthew 5:39ff).\n\n\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\n\n\n\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\nthey *aren't* reducible to rules.\n  A set of rules is a moral code or a\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.\n  Such things can be very helpful\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.\n  The Great\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.\n  A\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.\"\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\nIS how God acts.\n  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.\n  That the \"conservatives\" have\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\n\n\n\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).\n  As a result,\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\n(or infamous) with Christianity.\n  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\n\nIt does not have a QU'RAN.\n  Specifically Christian scripture has very\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\nfor their efforts.\n  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\n\n\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\n\t that I hope to get to in a day

It\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\n\n\n\nI think you are begging the question.\n Why don't I and the (myriads\nof) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?\n[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up\nthe origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th\ncentury onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the\ngospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]"],["I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip).\n\nWhen xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely\nor in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed\nby using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if\nxlock is NOT running.\n  No other processes seem to affect my\nruntimes, yet this is very consistent!\n\nAny explanations, real or imagined :)",false,461,"I found an oddity with our SGI Indigo (MIPS R3000 chip).\n\nWhen xlock +nolock is running, and I am working remotely\nor in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed\nby using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if\nxlock is NOT running.\n  No other processes seem to affect my\nruntimes, yet this is very consistent!\n\nAny explanations, real or imagined :)"],["Hi netlanders,\n\nDoes anybody know if there is something like Macintosh Hypercard for any UNIX \nplatform?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n",false,462,"Hi netlanders,\n\nDoes anybody know if there is something like Macintosh Hypercard for any UNIX \nplatform?\n\n\nThanks in advance\n"],["I had posted this before, but the buyer fell through, so here goes again....\n",false,463,"I had posted this before, but the buyer fell through, so here goes again....\n"],["\n\n   \u003e\tI realize I'm entering this discussion rather late, but I do\n   \u003ehave one question.\n Wasn't it a Reagan appointee, James Watt, a\n   \u003epentacostal christian (I think) who was the secretary of the interior\n   \u003ewho saw no problem with deforestation since we were \"living in the\n   \u003elast days\" and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods\n   \u003eanyway?\n\n   I heard the same thing, but without confirmation that he actually said it.\n\n   It was just as alarming to us as to you; the Bible says that nobody knows\n   when the second coming will take place.\n",false,464,"\n\n   \u003e\tI realize I'm entering this discussion rather late, but I do\n   \u003ehave one question.\n Wasn't it a Reagan appointee, James Watt, a\n   \u003epentacostal christian (I think) who was the secretary of the interior\n   \u003ewho saw no problem with deforestation since we were \"living in the\n   \u003elast days\" and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods\n   \u003eanyway?\n\n   I heard the same thing, but without confirmation that he actually said it.\n\n   It was just as alarming to us as to you; the Bible says that nobody knows\n   when the second coming will take place.\n"],["I'm looking for a 1990-91 Kawasaki ZX-6 engine.\n  Just the engine,\nno intake, exhaust, ignition, etc.\n  Preferably in the central texas\narea, but we haven't had much luck around here so we'll take whatever we\ncan get.\n  Please reply via mail or call (512) 471-5399 if you have one\n(or more...  really need a spare).\n\n\nThanx\n",false,465,"I'm looking for a 1990-91 Kawasaki ZX-6 engine.\n  Just the engine,\nno intake, exhaust, ignition, etc.\n  Preferably in the central texas\narea, but we haven't had much luck around here so we'll take whatever we\ncan get.\n  Please reply via mail or call (512) 471-5399 if you have one\n(or more...  really need a spare).\n\n\nThanx\n"],["\n\n\nThis only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed\nencryption schemes.\n Otherwise, why not just use the front end without\nclipper?\n\nDavid\n",false,466,"\n\n\nThis only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed\nencryption schemes.\n Otherwise, why not just use the front end without\nclipper?\n\nDavid\n"],["I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem\ncable.

$7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee.\n Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure

Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.\n  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.\n  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.\n  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text \u002f graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.\n \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.\n  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.\n  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.\n  \nYellow shade, which are words that

eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \nthe United States.\n Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome).\n The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas.\n Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2).\n Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations.\n The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3).\n \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials.\n This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof

States,\n                                   1992-1993\n            =======================================================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n     From November 15, 1992, through February 28, 1993, more than 500 \nlaboratory-confirmed infections with E. coli O157:H7 and four associated \ndeaths occurred in four states -- Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada.\n \nThis report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that \nidentified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from \none restaurant chain.\n Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea.\n During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5).\n On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated.\n \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department.\n A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1).\n Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms.\n Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms.\n Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty.\n Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20.\n Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died.\n The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years).\n Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A).\n Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS.\n During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant.\n California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.\n \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.\n \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego.\n After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier.\n A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.\n \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B).\n The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients.\n Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died.\n The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years).\n A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99).\n A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).\n \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness.\n Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department.\n A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993.\n Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient.\n After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset.\n \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS.\n The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years).\n Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9).\n A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8).\n Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992.\n The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred.\n Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.\n \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination.\n The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states.\n No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.\n \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing.\n \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King

illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody \ndiarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2).\n This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children.\n Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3).\n Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \nhigher rate than for any other pathogen.\n \n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \nassociated with infection (4).\n The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent.\n Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications.\n Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.\n \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance.\n Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1).\n Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).\n \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases.\n \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter.\n CDC is collaborating with the U.S.\n \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.\n \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated.\n The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear.\n In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role.\n The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).\n \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks.\n The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7.\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n CDC.\n Preliminary report: foodborne outbreak of Escherichia coli

           1991\n            =======================================================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the \nUnited States almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1).\n Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).\n \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years.\n This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey.\n \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking.\n Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview.\n Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users.\n Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now.\n Ever smokers included current and former smokers.\n Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates.\n Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3).\n \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen.\n For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men.\n For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.\n The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians\u002fAlaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians\u002fAlaskan Natives and blacks.\n Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education.\n Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas.\n Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).\n \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2).\n Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.\n \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users.\n Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1).\n Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6).\n Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1).\n \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked.\n In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.\n \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6).\n \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC.\n \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males.\n Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility.\n Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).\n \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial\u002fethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation.\n For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).\n \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes.\n In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users.\n In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter

substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8).\n Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.\n \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian\u002fAlaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9).\n Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n Office of Evaluations and

Moose\nJudith Schrier\n\nAgain, thank you to all who gave!\n\nI have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to \nreview the product.\n  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.\n  \nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \nPackard Scanners.\n  \n\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \n(1) text \u002f graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.\n \n\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\n\n\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.\n  The \nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.\n  Blue which are words that were \nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.\n  \nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted \ncorrectly at all.\n  I have found that the software should give itself more \ncredit.\n  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.\n  If a word is shaded blue, \nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.\n  The only problem is the personal \ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.\n  I find this to be very limited, \nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.\n \n\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \nprocessor formats.\n  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\n\n\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.\n  I use \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page

received in \"standard\" mode (200x100 dpi), the \naccuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.\n \n\nOverall, a very impressive product.\n  The only fault I could find is the \nlimitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just \ntoo small.\n \n\nIf anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me

eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \nthe United States.\n Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome).\n The incidences \nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas.\n Furthermore, \ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2).\n Emerging \ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \nminority and underserved populations.\n The substantial economic burden of \nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \n(3).\n \n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \npublic health officials.\n This first article updates the ongoing investigation \nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n Burnet M.\n Natural history of infectious disease.\n Cambridge, England: \nCambridge University Press, 1963.

November 15, 1992, through February 28, 1993, more than 500 \nlaboratory-confirmed infections with E. coli O157:H7 and four associated \ndeaths occurred in four states -- Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada.\n \nThis report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that \nidentified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from \none restaurant chain.\n Washington \n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea.\n During January 16-17, a \ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5).\n On January \n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \nwas initiated.\n \n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \nstate health department.\n A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \n(Figure 1).\n Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \nsymptoms.\n Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms.\n Of the 338 patients \nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \na regular-sized hamburger patty.\n Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \nthrough January 20.\n Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \ndeveloped HUS, and three died.\n The median age of patients was 7.5 years \n(range: 0-74 years).\n Idaho \n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A).\n Four persons were \nhospitalized; one developed HUS.\n During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant.\n California \n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.\n \nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.\n \nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego.\n After the Washington outbreak was \nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier.\n A case was defined as \npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.\n \n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B).\n The \noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients.\n Fourteen \npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died.\n The median \nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years).\n A case-control study of \nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99).\n A study comparing case-patients \nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).\n \nChain B was not statistically associated with illness.\n Nevada \n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \ncontact the health department.\n A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993.\n Because local \nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient.\n After \nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \none patient 38 days after illness onset.\n \n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS.\n The median age was 30.5 years (range: \n0-83 years).\n Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \nlimit=4.9).\n A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\n49.8).\n Other Investigation Findings \n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \nNovember 20, 1992.\n The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred.\n Approximately 272,672 \n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.\n \n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \nthe likelihood of contamination.\n The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states.\n No one \nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.\n \n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing.\n \n\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King

illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody \ndiarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2).\n This pathogen has since \nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \ncause of acute renal failure in children.\n Outbreak investigations have linked \nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \nimplicated (3).\n Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E.

illnesses \nassociated with infection (4).\n The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent.\n Younger age groups \nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \ncomplications.\n Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.\n \n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance.\n Despite \nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \n(1).\n Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).\n \nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \nhealth action to prevent further cases.\n \n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \ncontaminate meat during slaughter.\n CDC is collaborating with the U.S.\n \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.\n \nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \ninternally contaminated.\n The optimal food protection practice is to cook \nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \nare clear.\n In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \nan important role.\n The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).\n \n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \noutbreaks.\n The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \ncoli O157:H7.\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n CDC.\n Preliminary report: foodborne outbreak of Escherichia coli

           1991\n            =======================================================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the \nUnited States almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1).\n Long-term use of \nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).\n \nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \nCDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years.\n This \nreport summarizes findings from this survey.\n \n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking.\n Current users of \nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \ntime of the interview.\n Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \nformer users.\n Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \nsmoking now.\n Ever smokers included current and former smokers.\n Data on \nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \nnational estimates.\n Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \n(3).\n \n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \nwomen.\n For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \nuse was substantially higher among men.\n For men, the prevalence of use was \nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.\n The prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians\u002fAlaskan \nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \nIndians\u002fAlaskan Natives and blacks.\n Among both men and women, prevalence of \nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education.\n Prevalence was \nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \nrural areas.\n Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).\n \n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2).\n Although \nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.\n \n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \nformer smokeless tobacco users.\n Among ever users, the proportion who were \nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1).\n Among persons \naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \nCI=64.2-76.6).\n Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \n95% CI=68.9-78.1).\n \n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked.\n In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.\n \n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\n49.6).\n \n\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC.\n \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \ntobacco was highest among young males.\n Adolescent and young adult males, in \nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility.\n Use of oral \nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).\n \n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \nracial\u002fethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \nfurther explanation.\n For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).\n \n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes.\n In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users.\n In a previous \nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\noccasionally (7).\n In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \nstop smoking (8).\n Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.\n \n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian\u002fAlaskan Native youth (to no more \nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9).\n Strategies to lower the \nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \nenforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n Office of Evaluations and

(...) It is evident that the\n  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and\n  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection\n  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,\n  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.\u003e\u003e\n\n\n  page 21:\n\n  \u003c\u003cIn the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official\n  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi\n  Chief Rabbi of the city.\n He was the most important rabbi in the city and\n  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation\n  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century.\n Sarfati himself was from\n  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two\n  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom\n  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European\n  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.\n\n  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant\n  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of\n  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who\n  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.\u003e\u003e (*)\n\n\n  page 41:\n\n \u003c\u003c...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were\n firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them\n and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians\n of Europe.\n\n\n Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is\n also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews\n as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.\n\n Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians\n representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed.\n European\n sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers.\n In addition\n it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their\n sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who\n regularly reported to the Ottomans.\n\n\n There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans\n in the struggle against European powers.\n The two best known instances\n of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited\n instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the\n early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes.\n We also have reports of sympathy\n for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios.\n An unpublished Ottoman\n document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some\n Greek towns...\u003e\u003e\n\n page 43:\n\n  \u003c\u003cIt is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally\n accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,\n and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of\n the situation.\u003e\u003e\n\n\n page 46:\n\n \u003c\u003c...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not\n particularly cordial.\n The two groups had little in common, few common\n interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition\n which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity.\n If\n there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between\n religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was\n that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with\n the Orthodox.\u003e\u003e\n\n page 46:\n\n \u003c\u003cThe general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context\n during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of\n interests.\n From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed\n Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already\n existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element.\n The Jewish\n response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian\n countries to Ottoman domains.\u003e\u003e\n\n page 151:\n\n  \u003c\u003cFrom the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the\n  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would\n  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,\n  in

(...) It is evident that the\n  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and\n  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection\n  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,\n  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.\u003e\u003e\n\n\n  page 21:\n\n  \u003c\u003cIn the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official\n  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi\n  Chief Rabbi of the city.\n He was the most important rabbi in the city and\n  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation\n  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century.\n Sarfati himself was from\n  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two\n  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom\n  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European\n  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.\n\n  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant\n  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of\n  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who\n  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.\u003e\u003e (*)\n\n\n  page 41:\n\n \u003c\u003c...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were\n firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them\n and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians\n of Europe.\n\n\n Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is\n also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews\n as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.\n\n Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians\n representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed.\n European\n sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers.\n In addition\n it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their\n sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who\n regularly reported to the Ottomans.\n\n\n There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans\n in the struggle against European powers.\n The two best known instances\n of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited\n instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the\n early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes.\n We also have reports of sympathy\n for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios.\n An unpublished Ottoman\n document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some\n Greek towns...\u003e\u003e\n\n page 43:\n\n  \u003c\u003cIt is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally\n accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,\n and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of\n the situation.\u003e\u003e\n\n\n page 46:\n\n \u003c\u003c...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not\n particularly cordial.\n The two groups had little in common, few common\n interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition\n which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity.\n If\n there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between\n religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was\n that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with\n the Orthodox.\u003e\u003e\n\n page 46:\n\n \u003c\u003cThe general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context\n during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of\n interests.\n From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed\n Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already\n existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element.\n The Jewish\n response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian\n countries to Ottoman domains.\u003e\u003e\n\n page 151:\n\n  \u003c\u003cFrom the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the\n  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would\n  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,\n  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and\n  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions\n  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the\n  Jews recognized their mutual interests...\u003e\u003e\n\n  page 161:\n\n  \u003c\u003cIt is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success\n  of the Ottomans in

however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992.\n Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992.\n Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000).\n \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1).\n Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts;

in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1).\n During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites.\n In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1).\n Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.\n \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD\u002fAIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.\n JM Douglas, MD, \nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals.\n Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC.\n \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992.\n The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.\n \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.\n \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2).\n Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment.\n To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD\u002fAIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation.\n \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7).\n Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs.\n Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts.\n Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.\n \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD\u002fAIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods.\n The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers.\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n CDC.\n Table II.\n Cases of selected notifiable diseases, United States, weeks \nending December 26, 1992, and December 28, 1991 (52nd week).\n MMWR 1993;41:975. \n\n2.\n CDC.\n Gang-related outbreak of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae \nand other sexually transmitted diseases -- Colorado Springs, Colorado, 1989-\n1991.\n MMWR 1993;42:25-8. \n\n3.\n CDC.\n Relationship of syphilis to drug use and prostitution -- Connecticut \nand Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n MMWR 1988;37:755-8, 764. \n\n4.\n Rolfs RT, Goldberg M, Sharrar RG.\n Risk factors for syphilis: cocaine use \nand prostitution.\n Am J Public Health 1990;80:853-7. \n\n5.\n Andrus JK, Fleming DW, Harger DR, et al.\n Partner notification: can it \ncontrol epidemic syphilis?

States,\n                                 1988 and 1989\n            ======================================================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n     Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and \nyoung adults in the United States and account for more than 1 million years of \npotential life lost before age 65 annually (1).\n Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2).\n From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children.\n Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5).\n In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6).\n To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989.\n This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy.\n \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC.\n Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household.\n Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child.\n The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).\n \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state.\n Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals.\n Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05.\n \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law.\n Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone).\n In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.\n \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states).\n \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel.\n Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively).\n \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1).\n Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds).\n In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds).\n When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).\n \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1).\n In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8).\n \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.\n \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9).\n Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10).\n \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report.\n Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment.\n Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children.\n \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children.\n In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page

wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts.\n Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5).\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n CDC.\n Childhood injuries in the United States.\n Am J Dis Child 1990;144:627-\n46. \n\n2.\n

  AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 \n\n     Problem\u002fCondition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance \nsystems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.\n \n     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988.\n \n     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods.\n The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta.\n The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.\n \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation\u002fdysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney\u002fureter, and scoliosis\u002flordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability.\n However, differences in the prevalences of arm\u002fhand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose.\n \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida.\n However, \nthe reason for differences in arm\u002fhand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation.\n \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented.\n In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.\n Authors: Jane Schulman, Ph.D., Nancy \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\nVolume

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89\n\n     Problem\u002fCondition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza \nvirus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually \nfrom October through May.\n \n     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989.\n \n     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.\n \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year.\n \n     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season.\n Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated.\n Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season.\n During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1).\n \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.\n \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine.\n CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.\n \nAuthors:

               Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation.\n Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures.\n \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and\u002for \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement.\n However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures.\n \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures.\n This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies.\n \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success.\n Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.\n \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies.\n \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease.\n \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.\n \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia.\n We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders.\n \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children.\n \n\n\nCatherine

Endocrinology and Infertility.\n \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.\n  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus.\n All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions.\n Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses.\n To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and\u002for GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel).\n Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles.\n While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.\n  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and\u002for mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.\n  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle.\n Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.\n \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.\n  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts.\n However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception.\n Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies.\n \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy.\n Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age.\n We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age.\n Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor.\n Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.\n \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs\u002ftube).\n Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle.\n This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand\u002for idiopathic infertility.\n    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent).\n In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET.\n However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient.\n These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos.\n \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure.\n Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.\n \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.\n \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos.\n Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.\n \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm\u002fml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and\u002for less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology).\n We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion.\n \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy.\n This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.\n \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation.\n Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception.\n \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10

 DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n     The number of reported cases of gonorrhea in Colorado increased 19.9% \nfrom 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s.\n In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1).\n This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992.\n \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991.\n During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1).\n Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992.\n Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992.\n Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000).\n \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1).\n Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)\u002facquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.\n \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%.\n Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%.\n Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively).\n \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased.\n Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).\n \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1).\n During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites.\n In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1).\n Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.\n \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD\u002fAIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.\n JM Douglas, MD, \nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals.\n Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC.\n \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992.\n The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.\n \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.\n \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2).\n Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment.\n To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD\u002fAIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation.\n \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7).\n Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs.\n Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts.\n Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.\n \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD\u002fAIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods.\n The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers.\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n CDC.\n Table II.\n Cases of selected notifiable diseases, United

States,\n                                 1988 and 1989\n            ======================================================\n                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n     Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and \nyoung adults in the United States and account for more than 1 million years of \npotential life lost before age 65 annually (1).\n Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2).\n From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children.\n Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5).\n In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6).\n To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989.\n This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy.\n \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC.\n Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household.\n Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child.\n The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).\n \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state.\n Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals.\n Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05.\n \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law.\n Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone).\n In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.\n \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states).\n \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel.\n Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively).\n \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1).\n Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds).\n In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds).\n When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).\n \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1).\n In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8).\n \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.\n \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9).\n Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10).\n \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report.\n Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment.\n Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children.\n \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children.\n In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page

wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts.\n Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5).\n \n\nReferences\n\n1.\n CDC.\n Childhood injuries in the United States.\n Am J Dis Child 1990;144:627-\n46. \n\n2.\n

42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993\n\n     Since 1983, CDC has published the CDC Surveillance Summaries under \nseparate cover as part of the MMWR series.\n Each report published in the CDC \nSurveillance Summaries focuses on public health surveillance; surveillance \nfindings are reported for a broad range of risk factors and health conditions.\n \n     Summaries for each of the reports published in the most recent (March 19, \n1993) issue of the CDC Surveillance Summaries (1) are provided below.\n All \nsubscribers to MMWR receive the CDC Surveillance Summaries, as well as the \nMMWR Recommendations and Reports, as part of their subscriptions.\n\n\n SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES\n                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC \n                        AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 \n\n     Problem\u002fCondition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance \nsystems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.\n \n     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance \nin metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for \nthe years 1983-1988.\n \n     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program \nand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-\nbased surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods.\n The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta.\n The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.\n \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation\u002fdysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney\u002fureter, and scoliosis\u002flordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability.\n However, differences in the prevalences of arm\u002fhand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose.\n \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida.\n However, \nthe reason for differences in arm\u002fhand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation.\n \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented.\n In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.\n Authors: Jane Schulman, Ph.D., Nancy \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\nVolume

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89\n\n     Problem\u002fCondition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza \nvirus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually \nfrom October through May.\n \n     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance \nconducted from October 1988 through May 1989.\n \n     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices \nof 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO \ncollaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza \nviruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and \nterritorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.\n \nNonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received \nthroughout the year.\n \n     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B \nviruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency \noverall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted \nover the course of the season.\n Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated.\n Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season.\n During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1).\n \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.\n \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine.\n CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.\n \nAuthors:

               Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona\n\n                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-\nET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been \ndeveloped that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), \nembryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation.\n Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures.\n \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and\u002for \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement.\n However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures.\n \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures.\n This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies.\n \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success.\n Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.\n \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies.\n \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease.\n \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.\n \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia.\n We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders.\n \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children.\n \n\n\nCatherine

Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility.\n \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.\n  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus.\n All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions.\n Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses.\n To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and\u002for GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel).\n Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles.\n While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.\n  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and\u002for mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.\n  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle.\n Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.\n \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.\n  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts.\n However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception.\n Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies.\n \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy.\n Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age.\n We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age.\n Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor.\n Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.\n \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs\u002ftube).\n Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle.\n This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand\u002for idiopathic infertility.\n    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent).\n In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET.\n However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient.\n These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos.\n \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure.\n Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.\n \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.\n \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos.\n Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.\n \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm\u002fml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and\u002for less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology).\n We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion.\n \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy.\n This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.\n \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation.\n Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception.\n \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10

am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\nby a 3D scanline renderer.\n \n\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\nhave never had the need to implement such a system.\n Well, I now have the\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\n\n\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even\u002fodd or non-winding rules to\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\npolygons).\n For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\n\n\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\n\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\n\n\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\ntwo outlines are closest.\n This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\nholes\".\n The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\n\n\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\n\n\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a
