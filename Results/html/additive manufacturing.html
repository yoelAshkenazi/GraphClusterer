known as 3D printing (3DP), and other technology using 3D bioprinting techniques have been used in medical applications for more than 10 years.\n Currently the primary use of AM in orthopedics is production of implants for total joint arthroplasties.\n These implants are not individually personalized but use an average bony morphology to develop sizes to fit patients in certain categories.\n Although the use of AM to produce a personalized arthroplasty implant is somewhat limited by materials and in some cases by a lengthy postprocessing window, the use of AM is estimated to grow at an annual rate of nearly 16% by 2020.\n Custom-made patient-specific instruments and implants may produce better outcomes in patients with abnormal anatomy, complex fractures, or neoplasms for whom traditional manufacturing methods are unable to produce an implant.\n Also, in the future, if scaffolds with cellular products can be fashioned using bioprinting methods, then exact surface morphometry may be produced for a biologic implant and resurfacing of the joint.\n The next technological leap in 3DP for arthroplasty may actually come from bioprinting.\n The use of collagen

manufacturing has attracted considerable interest as a promising digital manufacturing technology in recent years.\n However, poor surface quality restricts its practical application.\n In this paper, we demonstrate the capability of laser polishing in rough surface of additive manufactured Inconel 718 alloy.\n Both as-received surface and laser-polished surface were analyzed carefully by Confocal Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectrometer and X-ray Diffraction.\n The results revealed that as-received Inconel 718 alloy with surface roughness more than 7 \u00b5m could be reduced to less than 0.1 \u00b5m through laser polishing (LP) process.\n Moreover, microstructure, micro-hardness and wear resistance of laser-polished zone were investigated.\n This preliminary study has shown the potential of laser polishing in improving surface finish and properties of additive manufactured superalloy without damage to the substrate.\n"],["Abstract Additively

selective laser melted (SLM) materials were studied.\n A submicron structure was introduced in a SLM Ag\u2013Cu\u2013Ge alloy that showed semicoherent precipitates distributed in a discontinuous but

twins.\n However, the samples fractured before necking owing to the crack acceleration along the external defects.\n This work provides an approach for additively manufacturing materials with an

remodeling.\n Due to the limitations of autograft and allograft methods, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has become increasingly important.\n Since BTE scaffolds must have unique properties to adapt to the patient\u2019s body, it is crucial to choose the material and the method of making these scaffolds.\n Additive manufacturing (AM) is a relatively new method for making these scaffolds.\n In this chapter, different AM methods and materials for making BTE scaffolds are examined.\n It can be seen that among the seven categories of AM methods, EBM and SLM are more used in the construction of BTE scaffolds.\n And various materials such as ceramics, metals, synthetic and natural polymers, and composites, as well as their pros and cons were discussed.\n Using the AM method, scaffolds can be made with different kinds of structures and porosities.\n Unit cells to make these structures can be polyhedron, TPMS, Truss, and FGS, each of which will be elaborated in this chapter.\n Experimental studies show that growth factor, porosity, scaffold structure, and the material play a vital role in obtaining the desired mechanical properties.\n"],["Additive manufacturing systems, which have

areas have been included particularly from a medical science point of view.\n This paper ends with a dedicated section on applications of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in orthopedic, dental, prosthetics, food and textile sectors.\n It tries to establish relationships between AM, industry 4.0 and sustainability.\n This paper shall act as a stimulant to trigger further advancements in the above fields.\n"],["Large bone defects, which occur due to various causes, have substantially affected people's health and quality of life.\n Bone tissue engineering (BTE) is a promising approach for repairing or replacing bone injuries.\n The aim of BTE scaffolds is to mimic the biological function and structure of the natural bone extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides a three-dimensional (3D) environment for cell adsorption, proliferation and differentiation.\n Significant advances in materials science, computer-aided design (CAD) and biomedical engineering have facilitated BTE scaffolds.\n This paper describes the requirements of BTE scaffolds and highlights the important role of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies in building bridges between biomaterials, CAD models and additives, and BTE scaffolds.\n It reviews various AM technologies that are used to fabricate BTE scaffolds.\n These technologies are divided into seven categories: (1) stereolithography (SLA), (2) powder bed fusion (PBF), (3) binder jetting (BJ), (4) material extrusion (ME), (5) material jetting (MJ), (6) volumetric printing (VP) and (7) 4D printing (4DP).\n The characteristics, raw
