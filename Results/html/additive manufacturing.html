facilitated BTE scaffolds.\n This paper describes the requirements of BTE scaffolds and highlights the important role of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies in building bridges between biomaterials, CAD models and additives, and BTE scaffolds.\n It reviews various AM technologies that are used to fabricate BTE scaffolds.\n These technologies are divided into seven categories: (1) stereolithography (SLA), (2) powder bed fusion (PBF), (3) binder jetting (BJ), (4) material extrusion (ME), (5) material jetting (MJ), (6) volumetric printing (VP) and (7) 4D printing (4DP).\n The
