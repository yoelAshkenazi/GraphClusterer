that are used in different industry sectors, such as aerospace, medicine, turbines, and jewelry, where the utilization of other fabrication techniques is difficult or impossible.\n This method is advantageous in terms of dimensional accuracy and fabrication speed.\n However, the parts fabricated by this method may suffer from faults such as anisotropy, micro-porosity, and defective joints.\n Metals like titanium, aluminum, stainless steels, superalloys, etc., have been used-in the form of powder or wire-as feed materials in the additive manufacturing of various parts.\n The main criterion that distinguishes different additive manufacturing processes from each other is the deposition method.\n With regard to this criterion, AM processes can be divided into four classes: local melting, sintering, sheet forming, and electrochemical methods.\n Parameters affecting the properties of the additive-manufactured part and the defects associated with an AM process determine the method by which a certain part should be manufactured.\n This study is a survey of different additive manufacturing processes, their mechanisms, capabilities, shortcomings, and the general properties of the parts manufactured by them.\n"],["After the first big hype on additive manufacturing in medical industry the technology of 3D printing is now reaching a productive stage for some selected
