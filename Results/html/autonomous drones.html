utilization of drones for various tasks, such as monitoring, surveillance, and delivery, has become increasingly prevalent due to advancements in technology.\n However, the development of fully autonomous drones for these tasks presents numerous challenges, including safe movement, collision avoidance, and the ability to operate in unknown environments.\n One significant challenge is the need for drones to have the capability to move autonomously, which is crucial for their safe operation, especially in complex and unpredictable environments.\n The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning and potential field methods, has been proposed to address this challenge.\n These methods enable drones to learn and adapt to their surroundings, allowing them to navigate through obstacles and find optimal paths.\n Another critical aspect of autonomous drone movement is the ability to operate safely in unknown environments.\n Most current systems rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) for localization, which may not be suitable in certain situations due to accuracy limitations.\n To overcome this issue, researchers have
