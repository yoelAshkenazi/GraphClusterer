sharing sensing data are the main challenges in swarm-drone collaboration for performing complex tasks effectively and efficiently in real-time.\n Information security of consensus achievement is required for multi-drone collaboration in the presence of Byzantine drones.\n Byzantine drones may be enough to cause present swarm coordination techniques to collapse, resulting in unpredictable or calamitous results.\n One or more Byzantine drones may lead to failure in consensus while exploring the environment.\n Moreover, Blockchain technology is in the early stage for swarm drone collaboration.\n Therefore, we introduce a novel blockchain-based approach to managing multi-drone collaboration during a swarm operation.\n Within drone swarms, blockchain technology is utilized as a communication tool to broadcast instructions to the swarm.\n This paper aims to improve the security of the consensus achievement process of multi-drone collaboration, energy efficiency, and connectivity during the environment\u2019s exploration while maintaining consensus achievement effectiveness.\n Improving the security of consensus achievement among drones will increase the possibility and stability of multi-drone applications by improving connectivity and energy efficiency in the smart world and solving real environmental issues.\n"],["In this paper, we propose a drone

Sensfly flying wings is analyzed through the proposed methodology.\n The aerodynamic drag forces of each individual drone and the swarm are modeled theoretically.\n It is shown that drones through the swarming flight can save up to 70% of their energy and consequently improve their performance.\n As swarming drones have different loads and consume a different level of energy depending on their positions, there is a need to replace them during the flight in order to enhance their efficiency.\n To this end, regarding the number of drones, a replacement algorithm is defined for them so that they will be able to save more energy during their mission.\n It is shown that there is more than 21 percent improvement in flight time and distance of swarming drones after replacement.\n This method of replacement and formation can be considered as one of the effective factors in a drag reduction of swarming aerial vehicles.\n"],["Oil pollution in marine environments is a growing issue,
