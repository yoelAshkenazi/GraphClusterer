Over the last few decades, numerous conventional processes such as powder metallurgy techinques and casting have been proposed for the fabrication of cermet components. In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a promising method that can eliminate most of the limitations of conventional production methods. Among AM processes, selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM), laser engineering net shaping (LENS), direct laser fabrication (DLF), binder jet 3D printing, and 3D gel/direct-ink-write/robocasting printing have been investigated for manufacturing bulk cermet parts.

Discussion is then given over to how solidification microstructure is modified using processing conditions and utilisation of traditional casting methods which give rise to grain refinement and some cases ‘texture by design’. The review then makes observation and provides analysis on the typical material types reported in powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition. These are organised to efficiently highlight the key observations in terms of alloy creation and adaption with a specific focus on the relevant additive manufacturing technique. The emergent alloy families are also explored alongside the rapidly expanding topic of functionally graded alloys produced by the breadth of additive manufacturing techniques. The review concludes with a detailed critique of the state-of-the-art and an examination of where opportunities exist to advance the interdependency between process and emergent alloys exhibiting superior properties. The authors propose several areas worthy of consideration and attempt to provide inspiration for our community in the pursuit of new alloys and accompanying process designs for additive manufacturing.

Many conventional methods have been applied for manufacturing the polymer-based structures, but additive manufacturing (AM) as a new method brought several key advantages like cost-effectiveness and the capability of fabricating complicated parts with high accuracy. However, because of naturally inferior mechanical characteristics of the parts printed with monolithic polymers, developing printable polymer composites with high performance is required. So, progress in additively manufactured polymeric composites can be an effective step in various industrial applications. This article aims to overview on AM methods of polymeric composite materials such as stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused filament fabrication (FFF), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and binder jetting (BJ).

8,75,10,https://openalex.org/W2904494268,Additive Manufacturing in Medicine (12 vertices),"Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing (3DP), and other technology using 3D bioprinting techniques have been used in medical applications for more than 10 years. Currently the primary use of AM in orthopedics is production of implants for total joint arthroplasties. These implants are not individually personalized but use an average bony morphology to develop sizes to fit patients in certain categories. Although the use of AM to produce a personalized arthroplasty implant is somewhat limited by materials and in some cases by a lengthy postprocessing window, the use of AM is estimated to grow at an annual rate of nearly 16% by 2020. Custom-made patient-specific instruments and implants may produce better outcomes in patients with abnormal anatomy, complex fractures, or neoplasms for whom traditional manufacturing methods are unable to produce an implant. Also, in the future, if scaffolds with cellular products can be fashioned using bioprinting methods, then exact surface morphometry may be produced for a biologic implant and resurfacing of the joint. The next technological leap in 3DP for arthroplasty may actually come from bioprinting. The use of collagen matrices is now possible using current bioprinting technology as well as the combination of different cell types cultured from the patient, and then biologic resurfacing may be realized. If imaging technologies can be used to construct patient-specific articular cartilage geometry with articular cartilage cells cultured from the patient, then true biologic 3D-printed resurfacing may be realized in the next few decades."

The scaffold fabrication process generally involves scaffold design, AM, and post-treatments. Thus, this article firstly reviews the state-of-the-art of scaffold design, including computer-aided design, reverse modeling, topology optimization, and mathematical modeling. In addition, the current characteristics of several typical AM techniques, including selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling (FDM), and electron beam melting (EBM), especially their advantages and limitations are presented. In particular, selective laser sintering is able to obtain scaffolds with nanoscale grains, due to its high heating rate and a short holding time. However, this character usually results in insufficient densification. FDM can fabricate scaffolds with a relative high accuracy of pore structure but with a relative low mechanical strength. EBM with a high beam-material coupling efficiency can process high melting point metals, but it exhibits a low-resolution and poor surface quality. Furthermore, the common post-treatments, with main focus on heat and surface treatments, which are applied to improve the comprehensive performance are also discussed. Finally, this review also discusses the future directions for AM scaffolds for bone tissue engineering."
10,0,0,https://openalex.org/W2978990261,Additive Manufacturing in Medicine (12 vertices),"High-throughput fabrication techniques for generating arbitrarily complex three-dimensional structures with nanoscale features are desirable across a broad range of applications. Two-photon lithography (TPL)-based submicrometer additive manufacturing is a promising candidate to fill this gap. However, the serial point-by-point writing scheme of TPL is too slow for many applications. Attempts at parallelization either do not have submicrometer resolution or cannot pattern complex structures. We overcome these difficulties by spatially and temporally focusing an ultrafast laser to implement a projection-based layer-by-layer parallelization. This increases the throughput up to three orders of magnitude and expands the geometric design space. We demonstrate this by printing, within single-digit millisecond time scales, nanowires with widths smaller than 175 nanometers over an area one million times larger than the cross-sectional area."

Due to the limitations of autograft and allograft methods, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has become increasingly important. Since BTE scaffolds must have unique properties to adapt to the patient’s body, it is crucial to choose the material and the method of making these scaffolds. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a relatively new method for making these scaffolds. In this chapter, different AM methods and materials for making BTE scaffolds are examined. It can be seen that among the seven categories of AM methods, EBM and SLM are more used in the construction of BTE scaffolds.

Zinc is considered to be one of the promising biomaterials with respect to biodegradation rate and biocompatibility. However, no information regarding the biodegradability and biocompatibility of topologically ordered AM porous zinc is yet available. Here, we applied powder bed fusion to fabricate porous zinc with a topologically ordered diamond structure. An integrative study was conducted on the static and dynamic biodegradation behavior (in vitro, up to 4 weeks), evolution of mechanical properties with increasing immersion time, electrochemical performance, and biocompatibility of the AM porous zinc. The specimens lost 7.8% of their weight after 4 weeks of dynamic immersion in a revised simulated body fluid. The mechanisms of biodegradation were site-dependent and differed from the top of the specimens to the bottom. During the whole in vitro immersion time of 4 weeks, the elastic modulus values of the AM porous zinc (E = 700–1000 MPa) even increased and remained within the scope of those of cancellous bone. Indirect cytotoxicity revealed good cellular activity up to 72 h according to ISO 10,993–5 and -12. Live-dead staining confirmed good viability of MG-63 cells cultured on the surface of the AM porous zinc. These important findings could open up unprecedented opportunities for the development of multifunctional bone substituting materials that will enable reconstruction and regeneration of critical-size load-bearing bone defects.

In this study, we used additive manufacturing (selective laser melting) to develop multifunctional porous nitinol that combines superelasticity with a rationally designed microarchitecture and biofunctionalized surface. The rational design based on triply periodic minimal surfaces aimed to properly adjust the pore size, increase the surface area (thereby amplifying the effects of surface biofunctionalization), and resemble the curvature characteristics of trabecular bone. The surface of additively manufactured (AM) porous nitinol was biofunctionalized using polydopamine-immobilized rhBMP2 for better control of the release kinetics. The actual morphological properties of porous nitinol measured by microcomputed tomography (e.g., open/close porosity, and surface area) closely matched the design values. The superelasticity originated from the austenite phase formed in the nitinol porous structure at room temperature. Polydopamine and rhBMP2 signature peaks were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tests. The release of rhBMP2 continued until 28 days. The early time and long-term release profiles were found to be adjustable independent of each other. In vitro cell culture showed improved cell attachment, cell proliferation, cell morphology (spreading, spindle-like shape), and cell coverage as well as elevated levels of ALP activity and increased calcium content for biofunctionalized surfaces as compared to as-manufactured specimens. The demonstrated functionalities of porous nitinol could be used as a basis for deployable orthopedic implants with rationally designed microarchitectures that maximize bone tissue regeneration performance by release of biomolecules with adjustable and well-controlled release profiles."

We developed a lithography-based process to create complex 3D nano-architected metals with ~100 nm resolution. We first synthesize hybrid organic-inorganic materials that contain Ni clusters to produce a metal-rich photoresist, then use two-photon lithography to sculpt 3D polymer scaffolds, and pyrolyze them to volatilize the organics, which produces a >90 wt% Ni-containing architecture. We demonstrate nanolattices with octet geometries, 2 μm unit cells and 300-400-nm diameter beams made of 20-nm grained nanocrystalline, nanoporous Ni. Nanomechanical experiments reveal their specific strength to be 2.1-7.2 MPa g-1 cm3, which is comparable to lattice architectures fabricated using existing metal AM processes.

This work primarily focuses on defining hybrid-AM in relation to hybrid manufacturing (HM) and classifying hybrid-AM processes. Hybrid-AM machines, materials, structures, and function are also discussed. Hybrid-AM processes are defined as the use of AM with one or more secondary processes or energy sources that are fully coupled and synergistically affect part quality, functionality, and/or process performance. Historically, defining HM processes centered on process improvement rather than improvements to part quality or performance; however, the primary goal for the majority of hybrid-AM processes is to improve part quality and part performance rather than improve processing. Hybrid-AM processes are typically a cyclic process chain and are distinguished from postprocessing operations that do not meet the fully coupled criterion. Secondary processes and energy sources include subtractive and transformative manufacturing technologies, such as machining, remelting, peening, rolling, and friction stir processing (FSP).

As a step toward integrating testing and characterization into the AM process while reducing cost, we propose the automated testing and characterization of AM (ATCAM). ATCAM is configured for fused deposition modeling (FDM) and introduces the concept of dynamic coupons to generate large quantities of basic AM samples. An in situ actuator is printed on the build surface to deploy coupons through impact, which is sensed by a load cell system utilizing machine learning (ML) to correlate AM data. We test ATCAM’s ability to distinguish the quality of three PLA feedstock at differing price points by generating and comparing 3000 dynamic coupons in 10 repetitions of 100 coupon cycles per material. ATCAM correlated the quality of each feedstock and visualized fatigue of in situ actuators over each testing cycle. Three ML algorithms were then compared, with Gradient Boost regression demonstrating a 71% correlation of dynamic coupons to their parent feedstock and provided confidence for the quality of AM data ATCAM generates."

Design/methodology/approach Data have been collected through a worldwide survey. Respondents were from 105 companies adopting the technology from 23 countries worldwide. Findings The results of this research show that although AM-based prototyping leads to significant cost reduction, it is not as good as conventional manufacturing in terms of the profitability of investment. It also demonstrates how cost reduction depends on production volume and payback period depends on the types of material and scope of AM implementation after controlling for firm size and experience. Research limitations/implications The performance indicator is measured using a Likert scale; however, more reliable conclusion could be made by real amounts. The research also took into account the economic aspects of performance; however, to evaluate the AM technology more comprehensively, other performance measures such as those of social and environmental ones should be considered. Practical implications The paper provides insightful implications for the adoption of AM. In particular, it reveals the contingent performance of the technology in RP. Originality/value This paper contributes to expand the literature by demonstrating how different circumstances affect the performance of AM technologies for prototyping and by linking the operational and organizational factors with its performance."

Hence, a proportionate and purposive choice of such technologies would significantly impact the success of a firm. Additive Manufacturing, a leading and impactful technology, is being implemented in many industrial sectors and for a variety of reasons. It presents huge potential benefits in terms of sustainability perspectives. This paper aims to identify and prioritize the determinants of its adoption as well as to clarify the role of sustainability benefits in the decision to adopt. Then, the research seeks to distinguish the priorities of different application sectors through a multi-stage survey. The results show that environmental sustainability benefits are barely relevant to adoption decisions in practice and this is in contrast with the literature stating the huge sustainability benefits. Moreover, the results prove the pivotal role of economic motives in adoption decisions. The findings also indicate that the capability of additive manufacturing for producing almost any complex design is the key driver of its adoption in all sectors."

Three-dimensional printed connectors can be directly integrated into the radio-frequency (RF) circuit without post-process bonding and can be fabricated into unusual shapes. The flexibility this affords in the manufacturing process offers significant advantages, especially for applications that need to meet strict size and volume constraints. To that end, we describe modifications to the traditional SMA design that better enable AM fabrication. A variety of different connector geometries were printed and fully characterized both electromagnetically and mechanically. Experimental measurements up to 18 GHz demonstrated good RF performance with low insertion losses (< 0.5 dB). Mechanical testing showed that the printed connectors could withstand up to 4.5 kg of direct force for extended periods of time without damage to the printed threads or other connector parts. Additionally, the printed connectors demonstrated good RF performance after repeated use."

The unique characteristics of AM, such as gradient materials and micro-structures, have opened up a new direction in jet engine design and manufacturing. Engineers have been liberated from many constraints associated with traditional methodologies and technologies. One of the most significant features of the AM process is that it can ensure the consistency of parts because it starts from point(s), continues to line(s) and layer(s), and ends with the competed part. Collaboration between design and manufacturing is the key to success in fields including aerodynamics, thermodynamics, structural integration, heat transfer, material development, and machining. Engineers must change the way they design a part, as they shift from the traditional method of “subtracting material” to the new method of “adding material” in order to manufacture a part. AD is not the same as designing for AM. A new method and new tools are required to assist with this new way of designing and manufacturing. This paper discusses in detail what is required in AD and AM, and how current problems can be solved."

Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to fully take advantage of this technology because it implies a different approach to engineering design. The dependencies of AM on related technologies, such as material modeling, design tools, computing, and process design represent a challenge for engineers. A comprehensive system engineering approach is needed to address the introduction of AM in new design projects. This article proposes a systems design approach to evaluate the use of AM in the development of new systems at the early stage of design. The methodology aims to provide a preliminary estimation of performance, cost, and time of parts manufactured using additive techniques. The article introduces a set of design drivers and criteria to standardize the design process and support the manufacturing technique decision-making process. The methodology is experimentally tested and validated by evaluating tradeoffs for two different case studies considering different engineering parameters. The analysis of the results shows a good consistency between framework predictions and experimental evidence, with an uncertainty level lower than 5%. The reliability of obtained results is discussed."

Slipcasting technique was used to prepare sample as a traditional way, from pink alumina ceramic slurry with further drying a high temperature treatment of dried preformed ceramics. For preparation of second sample by additive route, stereolythography or SLA 3D-printing was used. This sample firstly formed a so called green body ceramic from photopolymerazed slurry, that forms an organo-inorganic composite with alumina as a filler. Preformed green body ceramic then undergoes a several stages of heat treatment: first is debinding process, at low temperature to rid of polymer binder and second stage is annealing at higher temperatures to fuse alumina particles together and get desired strength and porosity level.

74,1,0,https://openalex.org/W2805163661,Techniques for Additive Manufacturing (10 vertices),"One of the most perspective methods of additive manufacturing is selective laser melting. It allows producing the parts directly from 3D-model to 3D-object from metallic powders and alloys. Nowadays the method has very low productivity, which limits its extensive use and possible application to solve a modern design problem by introducing direct and fast metal production. The solution of its productivity would allow receiving metallic 3D-objects with complex geometry in short production period. The method was improved by the installation of laser beam profiling and online monitoring systems on the developed experimental setup. The profiler contributes to obtaining the alternative power density distributions of the laser beam. The CoCrMo powder was chosen because of its excellent melting qualities, and the initial powder was pre-treated with the purpose to get the diameter of the particles less than 20 μm. During the experiments, 3D-samples were obtained by the improved method of selective laser melting with parameters of two process windows for each of the laser beam spot. The 3D-samples were studied for the revelation of common material defects of the microstructure. The chemicalanalyses of the samples were implemented by scanning electronic microscopy. The analyses showed that the samples of each laser beam spot had defects related to the formation of a solid solution. Application of Inverse Gaussian laser beam spot into the SLM-machine for production of 3D-objects allows producing the pieces with the values of the parameters exceeding the value for Gaussian laser beam spot in several times. The typically recommended parameters for production of the piece on the modern SLM-machine are less than 100 W for laser source power and less than 30 mm/s for scanning speed. The analytical data, presented in the article demonstrated the field of process parameters, which can give a possibility to obtain 3D-object with the parameters up to 1 kW for laser source power and up to 0.3 m/s for scanning speed. The analyses of microstructure give a possibility to conclude about no visible difference between the formation of the objects with different laser beam spots. The online video-monitoring shows that with the application of laser beam profiling system the negative effects of the selective laser melting reduces visibly."

77,60,0,https://openalex.org/W3020233592,Techniques for Additive Manufacturing (10 vertices),"Abstract Additively manufactured metallic materials exhibit excellent mechanical strength. However, they often fail prematurely owing to external defects (pores and unmelted particles) that act as sites for crack initiation. Cracks then propagate through grain boundaries and/or cellular boundaries that contain continuous brittle second phases. In this work, the premature failure mechanisms in selective laser melted (SLM) materials were studied. A submicron structure was introduced in a SLM Ag–Cu–Ge alloy that showed semicoherent precipitates distributed in a discontinuous but periodic fashion along the cellular boundaries. This structure led to a remarkable strength of 410 ± 3 MPa with 16 ± 0.5% uniform elongation, well surpassing the strength-ductility combination of their cast and annealed counterparts. The hierarchical SLM microstructure with a periodic arrangement of precipitates and a high density of internal defects led to a high strain hardening rate and strong strengthening, as evidenced by the fact that the precipitates were twinned and encircled by a high density of internal defects, such as dislocations, stacking faults and twins. However, the samples fractured before necking owing to the crack acceleration along the external defects. This work provides an approach for additively manufacturing materials with an ultrahigh strength combined with a high ductility provided that premature failure is alleviated."

A three-dimensional microstructure with the grain geometry typical for aluminum alloys produced by selective laser melting is generated by the method of step-by-step packing. The grain behavior is described in terms of crystal plasticity with explicit consideration of the slip systems. A phenomenological equation is used to describe the critical resolved shear stress taking into account the grain cellular-dendritic substructure, grain boundary strengthening, and strain hardening. The microstructure-based constitutive model is used in simulations of quasistatic tension. In order to reduce the computational costs, quasistatic loading is simulated in terms of dynamics using an explicit time integration scheme which provides high numerical efficiency for solving non-linear problems. The calculation results for a polycrystalline model of additively manufactured aluminum alloy subjected to tension and shear along three different directions are presented to illustrate what might be obtained from the micromechanical simulations."

Microstructural investigations revealed that the as-manufactured material exhibited a multi-scale structure, composed of grains, cells, dislocations and nano-sized particles. Annealing at 400°C resulted in a 10% increase in yield strength, associated with the additional precipitation of a population of nano-sized silicates. Annealing at higher temperatures resulted in a decrease in strength, attributed primarily to the thermal instability of the cell structure in the as-manufactured material. The results demonstrate that by careful control of annealing conditions the structure and mechanical properties of additively-manufactured austenitic stainless steel can be optimized by post-manufacture heat-treatment."
80,2,0,https://openalex.org/W3133318470,Techniques for Additive Manufacturing (10 vertices),"One of the most actual issues in the development of construction printing is the development of sound methods for determining the main properties of additively obtained composites. And this applies not only to special properties, such as printability or shape stability, but also, it would seem, well-studied strength indicators. Most researchers in their works pay attention to the fact that the strength of samples obtained using molds does not correspond to the same indicator in printed structures. In this regard, this paper proposes a method for determining the strength of samples of standard sizes obtained by cutting out of a printed array. The array printing scheme assumes that each sample contains a large number of contact zones of layers, which are a weak point in the system under consideration. This approach allows considering the additively obtained composite as quasi-homogeneous, which makes it possible to simplify the calculation methods of structures and make them safer in operation. The analysis of the obtained results confirms the incorrectness of using standard methods for determining the strength indicators of additively manufactured materials when evaluating their design characteristics; the main direction for improving printing technology is the need to improve adhesion between layers; the expediency of increasing the width and thickness of tracks, which helps to reduce the number of contact zones. The proposed method is simple, accessible and does not require a special laboratory base."
