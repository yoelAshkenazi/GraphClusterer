Control of fasteners is great importance for travel safety. Missing, broken or deformed fasteners should be detected and repaired. In this study, a new method for fault detection is proposed by using a dataset consisting of railway images recorded using an autonomous drone. In deep learning, which has the potential of self-learning from the available data, the most important factor affecting model performance is data. In this study, obtaining the rail fastener images with an autonomous drone has provided an advantage compared to the existing studies in the literature. Deep learning training was conducted with Vgg16 and ResNet101V2, which are transfer learning models, in order to determine the faults caused by the lack of fasteners. The performances of the trained models in detecting faultless and missing/faulty fasteners were compared. In the results obtained, it was seen that the training made using the ResNet101V2 model with 99&#x0025; accuracy produced results with higher accuracy."
2,85,0,https://openalex.org/W4387444587,Advancements in Drone Technology (12 vertices),"Facilitating obstacle avoidance for autonomous drones (UAVs) is a key problem of their safe movement, including indoor applications. The complexity of this problem increases when a large group or a swarm of drones implementing coordinated movement is concerned. In this scenario, there can be problems with the standard methods, such as the potential field method. The jamming effect that occurs when a drone cannot efficiently bypass an obstacle on its way to the destination is the most widespread problem. This paper suggests an approach that uses a hybrid algorithm combining the standard potential field and the curl-free vector field. For the sake of brevity, the authors only review the fixed obstacle scenario. The usage of the curl-free vector field component can help remove the jamming effect during swarm movement. The theoretical analysis of stability is performed using Lyapunov’s direct method. To test the effectiveness of the approach, the authors used modeling in MATLAB/Simulink."

In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds, even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception, localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time. Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities."

Based on the state-of-the-art drone-to-user and drone-to-base station (D2B) channel models, we first analyze the user coverage and the D2B backhaul connection features of drone-cells. We then formulate the 3-D drone-cell deployment problem with the objective of maximizing the user coverage while maintaining D2B link qualities, for a given number of drone cells being deployed. To solve the problem, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is leveraged for its low computational cost and unique features suiting the spatial deployment of drone-cells. We propose a per-drone iterated PSO (DI-PSO) algorithm that optimizes drone-cell deployments for different drone-cell numbers, and prevents the drawbacks of the pure PSO-based algorithm derived from related works. Simulations show that the DI-PSO algorithm can achieve higher coverage ratio with less complexity comparing to the pure PSO-based algorithm."

With the widespread adoption of drones in IoT scenarios such as warfare, agriculture and delivery, effective solutions to protect data integrity and communications between drones and the control system have been in urgent demand to prevent potential vulnerabilities that may cause heavy losses. To secure drone communication during data collection and transmission, as well as preserve the integrity of collected data, we propose a distributed solution by utilizing blockchain technology along with the traditional cloud server. Instead of registering the drone itself to the blockchain, we anchor the hashed data records collected from drones to the blockchain network and generate a blockchain receipt for each data record stored in the cloud, reducing the burden of moving drones with the limit of battery and process capability while gaining enhanced security guarantee of the data. This paper presents the idea of securing drone data collection and communication in combination with a public blockchain for provisioning data integrity and cloud auditing. The evaluation shows that our system is a reliable and distributed system for drone data assurance and resilience with acceptable overhead and scalability for a large number of drones."

Duration of this stage is a few seconds. Drones are flying to the target, explode and die. The literature traditionally considers the attack and the anti-aircraft drones independently. It is proposed to identify the attacking and the anti-aircraft drones as a single oscillatory system with the antagonistic components. Antagonistic components are connected using the non-Newtonian elastic element. Test game with a high-explosive drone, test game with a fragmentation drone and 2D salvo game were considered. The game in this case is not a traditional minimax optimization problem, but appears to be simulation of the compromise unstable motion mode. Salvo of three attack drones in the 2D games is aimed against three stationary targets. Anti-aircraft salvo includes two high-explosive and two fragmentation drones. The attacking drones “know nothing” about the anti-aircraft target distribution; thus, each of them “avoids” the anti-aircraft drones simultaneously. One operator is playing. Therefore, the game has only two parameters, i.e. two different stiffness coefficients of any non-Newtonian elastic element. The non-Newtonian oscillatory system under study is non-oscillatory. There are violations of the well-known oscillation theorems of the oscillations theory: with the increasing rigidity, the system oscillation frequency drops, the oscillation forms acquire additional nodes, etc."

12,5,0,https://openalex.org/W4386258391,Advancements in Drone Technology (12 vertices),"Cash/valuables routing is vulnerable to attacks and robberies, so it is essential to prioritize transport security. This research employs a surveillance drone approach to enhance the transport security of cash/valuables routing. Using drones to identify suspicious and high-risk situations is a secure way to transport cash/valuables. Compared to ground-based operators, drones provide superior advantages such as improved security, efficiency, and accuracy. To this end, an integrated routing and surveillance problem is proposed to secure cash/valuables transport. In this problem, ground vehicles (GVs) and surveillance drones are routed in coordination. GVs are responsible for transporting and delivering cash/valuables, while drones are tasked with monitoring the GVs’ routes. The drone surveillance is as follows: before GVs leave the customers’ points, drones must surveil the GV through the link ahead and ensure their security. Links are surveilled in specific time windows. In this problem, charging stations are considered to swap drones’ batteries. In addition, an improved iterated local search (ILS) algorithm is designed in this study to optimize the proposed problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is then evaluated in small and large sizes. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed on some key parameters to assess the proposed model. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented in a real-world case study in Iran, with the results analyzed."

It is shown that different drag loads will be applied to various drones in a V-shaped swarm. The sensitivity of the drag of each drone to the wingspan and wingtip spacing in a V-shaped swarm is investigated. A load-balancing mechanism through lead-and-tail replacement is carried out in swarming drones and the flying distance improvement is analyzed. Moreover, in this paper, two different shuffling scenarios are compared with the head-and-tail replacement mechanisms. In the first shuffling method, the maximum-energy drone is replaced with the minimum-energy drone, iteratively. In the second shuffling method, the first two maximum-energy drones are repositioned with the leader and the tail drone, and the second two maximum go to the drone after the first and before the last drone. A similar process is applied for the rest of the drones. It is found that an optimum replacement mechanism can be defined for swarming drones in order to enhance their flight efficiency."

Designing an efficient routing protocol is challenging due to unique characteristics of these networks such as very fast motion of nodes, frequent changes of topology, and low density. Routing protocols determine how to provide communications between drones in a wireless ad hoc network. Today, reinforcement learning (RL) provides powerful solutions to solve the existing problems in the routing protocols, and designs autonomous, adaptive, and self-learning routing protocols. The main purpose of these routing protocols is to ensure a stable routing solution with low delay and minimum energy consumption. In this paper, the reinforcement learning-based routing methods in FANET are surveyed and studied. Initially, reinforcement learning, the Markov decision process (MDP), and reinforcement learning algorithms are briefly described. Then, flying ad hoc networks, various types of drones, and their applications, are introduced. Furthermore, the routing process and its challenges are briefly explained in FANET.

In this paper, the swarming flight of the fixed-wing drones and a load balancing mechanism during the swarm is investigated. As an example, the swarm flight of EBee Sensfly flying wings is analyzed through the proposed methodology. The aerodynamic drag forces of each individual drone and the swarm are modeled theoretically. It is shown that drones through the swarming flight can save up to 70% of their energy and consequently improve their performance. As swarming drones have different loads and consume a different level of energy depending on their positions, there is a need to replace them during the flight in order to enhance their efficiency. To this end, regarding the number of drones, a replacement algorithm is defined for them so that they will be able to save more energy during their mission. It is shown that there is more than 21 percent improvement in flight time and distance of swarming drones after replacement. This method of replacement and formation can be considered as one of the effective factors in a drag reduction of swarming aerial vehicles."

In this contribution, we review the current state-of-the-art highlighting how current solutions to respond to drones are completely ineffective against JAM-ME. In particular, we introduce our solution and its theoretical framework, and later we relax a few constraints of the baseline model (adding wind drift, and allowing the target to be randomly placed within the jammed area). Moreover, we run extensive simulations that do support our findings: even under the combined action of jamming and wind drift, the drone can reach a target randomly deployed in the jamming area-any other drone, under the same conditions, would have simply failed. As per the overhead, under very conservative assumptions, JAM-ME experiences an average overhead of 70%; however, note that such overhead can be reduced by at least a tenfold factor in practical settings-discussed in the paper.

The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles during flights, a fast local perception method and a sliding-windowed replanning method are integrated into our system, to generate safe and dynamically feasible local trajectories onboard. We name our system as teach-repeat-replan.

The problem concerns the deployment and routing of a fleet of trucks, each equipped with a supporting drone, to serve all the pickup and delivery demands of a set of customers with minimal total cost.

Moreover, goals are often specified using explicit time constraints which must be satisfied by the system perpetually. For example, drones carrying out the surveillance of some area must always have recent pictures, i.e., at most M time units old, of some strategic locations. This paper proposes a Multiset Rewriting language with explicit time for specifying and analysing TSDSes. We introduce two properties, realizability (some trace is good) and survivability (where, in addition, all admissible traces are good). A good trace is an infinite trace in which goals are perpetually satisfied. We propose a class of systems called progressive timed systems (PTS), where intuitively only a finite number of actions can be carried out in a bounded time period. We prove that for this class of systems both the realizability and the survivability problems are PSPACE-complete. Furthermore, if we impose a bound on time (as in bounded model-checking), we show that for PTS, realizability becomes NP-complete, while survivability is in the $$\varDelta _2^p$$ class of the polynomial hierarchy.

We developed a tethered robotic rover equipped with a 2D Lidar sensor to detect and localize a drone, and a robotic arm equipped with an inductive charging pad. The charging pad senses current measurements from individual inductive coils, and adjusts accordingly the robotic arm position to maximize charging rate. Such system, in principal, can cater for arbitrary drone shapes and landing positions and is less susceptible to external lighting and environmental conditions by the use of Lidar and current sensors instead of computer vision. We remark that our system can be also applied to charging other small electric vehicles."

Farmers are still reliant on a manual method to agricultural land care and management, one of which is the application of fertilizer to agricultural land. As a result, with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or a robot flying drone, a system or fertilizer sowing equipment is utilized on plants. The results of this study led to the creation of a hexacopter drone equipped with fertilizer-based sensors and GPS. Hexacopter refers to a quadcopter having only four rotors. Drone rides are paired with tank-shaped sower actuators and fertilizer spraying as a container and fertilizer sowing method. Using GPS sensor block m8n, which serves as a satellite signal receiver and is converted to a position point in the form of longitude and latitude values, the vehicle can travel to fertilize by following the route of the coordinate point that has been identified in the agricultural land region. The Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight control system, which uses automatic or autonomous controls, can run smoothly, allowing the ride to automatically seed the track. The Lippo 2300mAh 4s battery has a maximum ride load lifting capability of 500 grams of fertilizer and a fertilizing height of three meters."

A QCM is chosen for a drone using the shortest path algorithm considering the waiting time at a QCM, charging time, End-to-End (E2E) flight time and other similar time and distance-based criteria for the drone services. However, these methods lack reckoning the varying costs of charging by multiple service providers. Furthermore, such algorithms commonly do not consider the avoidance of no-drone cross-over zones. It is supposed that drone navigation and charging stations (DNCS) are to clearly identify drone trajectories, so both the overall traveled distance and drones charging costs are minimized simultaneously (without crossing over the no-drone zones). The results of simulation reveal the proposed algorithm’s remarkable cost-effectiveness and its avoidance from the risk of crossing over no-fly zone compared to the current planning methods accounting for only the shortest-path- based drone trajectory."

Further deployment of drones can promote the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though drones offer a number of advantages, they have limited flying time and weight carrying capacity. Effective drone schedules may assist with overcoming such limitations. Drone scheduling is associated with optimization of drone flight paths and may include other features, such as determination of arrival time at each node, utilization of drones, battery capacity considerations, and battery recharging considerations. A number of studies on drone scheduling have been published over the past years. However, there is a lack of a systematic literature survey that provides a holistic overview of the drone scheduling problem, existing tendencies, main research limitations, and future research needs. Therefore, this study conducts an extensive survey of the scientific literature that assessed drone scheduling.

The advent of autonomous drones has initiated serious challenges, including how to maintain their safe operation during their missions. The safe operation of UAVs remains an open and sensitive issue since any unexpected behavior of the drone or any hazard would lead to potential risks that might be very severe. The motivation behind this work is to propose a methodology for the safety assurance of drones over the Internet {(Internet of drones (IoD))}. Two approaches will be used in performing the safety analysis: (1) a qualitative safety analysis approach, and (2) a quantitative safety analysis approach. The first approach uses the international safety standards, namely ISO 12100 and ISO 13849 to assess the safety of drone's missions by focusing on qualitative assessment techniques. The methodology starts with hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and finally, draws the safety recommendations associated with a drone delivery use case. The second approach presents a method for the quantitative safety assessment using Bayesian Networks (BN) for probabilistic modeling. BN utilizes the information provided by the first approach to model the safety risks related to UAVs' flights. An illustrative UAV crash scenario is presented as a case study, followed by scenario analysis, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. These two analyses, qualitative and quantitative, enable { all involved stakeholders} to detect, explore and address the risks of UAV flights, which will help the industry to better manage the safety concerns of UAVs."

Ensuring collision avoidance is very important for the safe movement of autonomous drones indoors. FIRAS function-based potential field method is the standard for collision avoidance as implemented in isolated drones. However, its use in an autonomous swarm can be problematic. Its complex interconnected structure causes one of the known issues when there are multiple simultaneously active control objectives. They are intra-swarm collision avoidance and reaching the target relative distance (normally referred to as formation control). This paper shows that with collision avoidance active, the standard potential field method will cause a local minima-like effect in an autonomous swarm. To prevent it, this paper proposes a modified curl-free vector field-based algorithm. This modification enables extended lateral circular motion to prevent swarm members from getting stuck in a local minimum. Stability theory methods are invoked to show that the formation remains stable when running the proposed algorithm. Comparative numerical experiments were run on a drone swarm model in MATLAB/Simulink to illustrate the functioning of this algorithm.

A review of existing solutions has shown that most of the works lack the autonomy of drones because of nonscalable mapping techniques. This paper presents a method for centralized multi-drone 3D reconstruction, which allows performing a data capturing process autonomously and requires drones equipped only with an RGB camera. The essence of the method is a multiagent approach—the control center performs the workload distribution evenly and independently for all drones, allowing simultaneous flights without a high risk of collision. The center continuously receives RGB data from drones and performs each drone localization (using visual odometry estimations) and rough online mapping of the environment (using image descriptors for estimating the distance to the building). The method relies on a set of several user-defined parameters, which allows the tuning of the method for different task-specific requirements such as the number of drones, 3D model detalization, data capturing time, and energy consumption. By numerical experiments, it is shown that method parameters can be estimated by performing a set of computations requiring characteristics of drones and the building that are simple to obtain. Method performance was evaluated by an experiment with virtual building and emulated drone sensors. Experimental evaluation showed that the precision of the chosen algorithms for online localization and mapping is enough to perform simultaneous flights and the amount of captured RGB data is enough for further reconstruction."

In this regard, there is a need to have a large number of bee colonies for pollination by the beginning of flowering (in May-June) of entomophilous agricultural crops in a short time. Providing a sufficient number of bees is difficult when the queen bees naturally fly around, even if they are reared in nursing families due to weather conditions (wind, low temperature, etc.). To achieve this goal, instrumental insemination of queen bees is used.
