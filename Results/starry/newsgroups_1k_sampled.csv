In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person
is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably
be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.

He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad
stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to
learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took
that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived
in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't
and wouldn't play a lick of defense.

It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought
all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has
certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at
this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up
permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it
wouldn't matter.

every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have

So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues

Steve,

If the Israelis are stupid enough to ""allow"" a second ""Palestinian""
state (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your
wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

However, if the ""Palestinians"" were to somehow demonstrate that 
they could govern themselves AND live in peace with their 
Jewish neighbors, then they would have to give up the idea of
Jerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.

the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which
requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns
whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn
method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several
comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the
transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the
screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My
method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the
screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of
something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so
merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are
looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this
method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.

52,0,0,432,Computer and Social Discussions (33 vertices),"Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a
boat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of
reference points whose true x,y positions are known.  

Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron
Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which
converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click
the mouse.

Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come
out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways
from the known true values.  This is understandable because the
scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are
successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and
contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,
scanner errors and what have you.

The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so ""global""
adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or
rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.

So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for
removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of
points 

Reference(x,y) (the known true values)

DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)

DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)

what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to
DistortedData to remove the errors.

I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted
reference points as resulting from the projection of a ""bumpy"" 3d
surface, solving for the surface and then ""flattening"" it to remove
the errors in the other data points.

Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,
pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

This is becoming a tiresome statement.  Coming from you it is 
a definition, not an assertion:

   Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a 
   believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is
   good. Blah blah blah.

That's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To
say that something produces only good because it is only good that 
it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And
all you're application is saying that it's true if you really 
believe it's true.  That's silly.

Conversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under
atheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true-
don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.  

Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and
caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no
logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for
example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering
without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of
some inaccessible god.

This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft

instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able

 Well, if you put things into historical perspective, the Turks
 moved into an area, which was inhabited by Greeks.  This is how the history
 between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been
 a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see
 why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened 
 between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that
 the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't
 going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two
 countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work
 there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.


 I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.
 Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.


 I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.
 I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece
 in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this
 means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many
 Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.


Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

93,100,0,470,Current Events and Discussions (17 vertices),"I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I
came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling
components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a
current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side
to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I
think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.

Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for
picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an
efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour).

Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the
temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably
its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no
leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
(although that would be a lousy way to control it).

What I would like to know is:

1: Are the above guesses correct?

2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?
   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm
   too fast when I unplug it)

3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like

Before whose glory angels veiled their eyes;
He spoke, ""Each jot and tittle of the law

Omar Daoud Jaber, a prisoner, recounts his experience of being beaten and humiliated during interrogations, while also noting the contrast between the humanity shown by his interrogator in personal phone calls and the brutality displayed during the interrogations. Omar was released after 38 days without charges, but others like Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi and Mustafa Barakat suffered more severe consequences, with Hassan becoming unresponsive and Mustafa dying after one day in detention. The Shabak interrogation wing, where these incidents occur, is off-limits to outsiders, and prisoners fear speaking out due to potential retaliation.

I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy 
a bunch of their stuff :).

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
look at it :).


Great!  Where can I buy it?

Another note: If ""Clipper"" increases the incentive to bring stronger 
encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at 
the moment.


I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it 
from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.
 

You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a 
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.


Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone 
*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute 
for the ""voice scramblers"" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.

I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style ""values-free"" methods, that
teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make ""choices"",
actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while
back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The
article included sources to contact for information on research verifying
these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring
abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.

The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula
were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is
reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy
rate.

The difference is not in ""contraceptive technology"" but in the values taught
to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have
legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that
they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the
values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of
these kids.

Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are
suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that
desired.  

Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't
we teach ""safe drug use"" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it
because we know that a class in ""how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to
use drugs"" would increase drug use?  Why isn't ""drug abstinence education""
barred from schools because it teaches ""religion""?  Aren't we abandoning
those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe
use?

Despite being misunderstood and exiled, the Coptic Church has actively participated in the ecumenical movement, aiming to reconcile theological differences with other Christian churches.

They argue that while fractals can provide useful results, particularly in data presentation and system testing, they are not always the best approach and may not be as widely applicable as some fractal proponents suggest. The author specifically questions the practicality of fractal compression, noting that despite the formation of Iterated Systems six years prior, there are still no real products utilizing this technology. They also mention the lack of competition with established compression methods like JPEG.

It asserts the existence of three distinct persons in the Godhead: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. These three persons are one in nature, sharing divine attributes such as eternity, omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence. They are equally worthy of worship, trust, and obedience.

God's nature is revealed through His name, Jehovah, signifying His eternal and unchanging nature. He is a spirit, characterized by love, grace, mercy, goodness, faithfulness, and patience. Yet, He is also holy and righteous, incapable of sin. 

The Godhead is involved in creation and salvation. All three persons actively participated in creating and sustaining the universe, and they continue to order human affairs. In salvation, God the Father initiated the plan, electing those who would be saved. Jesus Christ, the Son, came to earth to reveal the Father and provide salvation through His life, death, resurrection, and ongoing intercessory work. The Holy Spirit, the Author of Scripture, convicts of sin, regenerates, indwells, seals, baptizes, teaches, and empowers believers for service.

  In a word, yes.  I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of
impact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create
life through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life
through in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely 
cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to
approach the glory of God.
  The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we
will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality
unwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!
  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't

I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire.

But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems
to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees
the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her
either.

The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is
to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the
players from trying to kill each other. 

Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most
of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires
need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.

that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the

The system, known as Clipper, would allow the government to wiretap and decrypt conversations on Clipper phones, which are intended for ordinary citizens. The author argues that this system primarily targets criminals, such as terrorists and drug dealers, but also raises concerns about the government's ability to wiretap average citizens. The author suggests that criminals could steal or replace Clipper chips to communicate securely, or they might resort to other secure encryption methods. Additionally, the author implies that the government might tap into ordinary citizens' Clipper phones, which could lead to further criminal threats and potential restrictions on strong encryption devices."

223,80,0,28,"Energy, Technology, and Worship (19 vertices)","A new study from the Cato Institute challenges the idea of government-mandated energy conservation, arguing that it is unnecessary and wasteful. The study, authored by Jerry Taylor, refutes the notion that we are running out of energy sources, highlighting the significant increase in proven oil, coal, and natural gas reserves globally. It also dispels the misconception that the US is less energy-efficient than other developed nations, considering factors like standard of living and population density. The report criticizes utilities' demand-side management programs for promoting free riders and distorting resource usage, and asserts that market economies are more energy-efficient than centrally planned ones. Furthermore, it concludes that government control over energy conservation imposes unnecessary costs, wastes energy, and transfers power to the state at the expense of individual liberty. The Cato Institute, named after libertarian pamphlets that influenced the American Revolution, is a public policy research foundation advocating for limited government and individual liberty. They publish a range of policy studies and host conferences to promote broader policy debate and engagement with the public."

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at
full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want
less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable
you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This
requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could
probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply
instruction and a few other DSP things.

If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a
second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000
8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1
compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about
V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.
Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need
sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a
PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap
- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the
SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't
sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation
a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be
required.

The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the
SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that
I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't
estimate how fast a PC you'd need.

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish,

sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is
classified.  As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is
_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper.

A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are
about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you
broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge

:had sex with children and women married to other men in the compound.  
:These were the ""perfect children"" resulting from the ""great seed"" of 
:his ""magnified horn"".  Ex-members describe him in ways not dissimilar 
:to the way Jim Jones has been described.

I don't know how accurate the documentary was; however, Koresh was never
convicted of any crimes against children, nor was the BATF after him for
child abuse.  Their purview (in this case) is strictly in firearms violations,
so this information is irrelevant to the discussion.

:FBI agents have to pass rigorous psychological examinations and background 
:checks.  Plus, those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain their 
:decisions in great detail to congress.  Why would the FBI want to fulfill 
:Koresh's own prophecy?

Those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain *something*, but whether
their answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never know.  And who
is left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled?  It only holds
meaning for the nine who survived.

:>Correction:  The *FBI* said that two of the cult members said this; so far,
:>no one else has been able to talk to them.
:
:So, when they talk to the news reporters directly, and relate the same 
:details, will you believe them?

*IF* they confirm the story, I probably will.  Definitely not until then, 
however.

Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war 
against Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is
the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals
only a few years ago.  


All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-
Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.



No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from
the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (
Palestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and 
""kill many Jews."") are caught.  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said, Paranoid
Jews live longer.

The author argues that hell is mentioned frequently in the Gospels and that it is an important aspect of eschatology, or the study of end times. They provide examples from the Bible, such as Revelation 20:11-15, to support the existence of hell and its role in judgment. The author also shares a story about a man who claimed not to believe in hell, but was unwilling to pray for his children to go there, suggesting that many people do not truly believe in the non-existence of hell. The text further emphasizes the importance of preaching the Gospel in its entirety, including the reality of hell, and highlights four reasons for the existence and eternality of hell: God's holiness, the dignity and accountability of man, the severity of sin, and the sacrifice of Christ."

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I
ask this again:

1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be
   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?

2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents?

3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,
   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).

NOTES:

   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter.
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents *if* they exist.
   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.

Thanx,
Eric.

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT.
Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was
never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it,
thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST --- 
one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).

The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down
our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any
mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and
the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved
in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not
fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending,
they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by
the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years).
While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up
in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business
rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent

The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal
heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias).  Some of them are very serious
while others are completely benign.  Having ""a few irregular beats""
on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and
when they occurred, or could be of no significance.

Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying
heart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are
clearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem
low-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat

in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to

when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated
(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't
seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all 
O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of

The panel's findings reveal that NRA members and gun enthusiasts are buying firearms at record rates, boosting the economy. However, domestic firearm manufacturers are hesitant to increase hiring despite the high demand. In response, President Clinton proposes a new gun control measure called the ""Ban-One-A-Month"" Gun Control Bill, which will ban a different type of firearm each month while allowing gun enthusiasts to continue purchasing them. This move is expected to further stimulate the economy and reduce the number of guns on the street. Senators have proposed amendments to the bill, including one that would ban all guns once all cards are drawn. The head of the BATF expressed concern about the timing of the proposed gun seizures.

Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*).
and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and
make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though
you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).

If you can make a ""CISC"" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)
with the ideas behind the ""RISC"" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then
I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC...

If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively

Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps
but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar
to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share
of GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to
be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious
if you thought about it.


It is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but
they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.

The chip includes a family key (F), a serial number (N), and a secret key (U). During encryption, the chip generates an encrypted message stream (E[M; K]) and a law enforcement field (E[E[K; U] + N; F]). The author raises concerns about the security implications of the algorithm. They argue that knowing the algorithm and the serial number (N) could lead to determining the family key (F), which would compromise the entire system. Additionally, knowledge of F could enable traffic analysis and potentially reveal communication patterns. The author also questions the key generation method and the possibility of weak keys being used. They emphasize the potential consequences of F being compromised, highlighting the importance of keeping cryptographic algorithms and keys secure."

Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)

A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the
OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will
unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from
another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers
(including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no
problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.

I have tried the following things:

    1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch
       (100444-37).

    2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.

    3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).
       This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of
       menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and
       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I
       was still able to get the application to hang.

This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.

Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)

Click and release on a menu item

Repeat until application hangs

feeder, they are now on sale, direct from TI for the unbelievable price of
$45! Call 1-800-847-2787.  Same for extra paper trays.  They have too many
gray ones and want to move them out. Strange but true.

It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not, there is some reasonable
thought in what you say here an I appreciate your point. However, I would make 2
remarks: 

 - you forgot about hate, and this is not only at government level.
 - It's not only 'arab' governments.

Now, about taugh talk and arrogance, we are adults, aren't we ? Do you listen 
to tough talk of american politicians ? or switch  the channel ? 
I would rather be 'intimidated' by some dummy 'talking tough' then by a 
bomb ready to blow under my seat in B747.

387,0,0,942,"Language, Tech, and Medicine (15 vertices)","I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too.  But of
course I knew that because it is so easy to do.  There is
not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes
every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the
colligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here).

Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted 
posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private
key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private
key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out
by a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants,
and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use
of the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for
non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key
but otherwises not encrypted.

Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining
mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be
easier to archive for people who might join a group ""late"" and
who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis
to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled;
three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize
available privacy measures on the internet.

And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such
keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.

We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William
Sessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it
collected for them.

There is something going on here.  It seems that once a month, the VW

That's not all that Kratz doesn't know.


Now we know that Kratz doesn't understand what a safety is supposed to
do.  (He also confuses ""things he can see"" with ""things that exist"";
Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
outside.)

A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that's
what the user wants.  With Glocks, one says ""I want the gun to go
off"" by pulling the trigger.  If the safeties it has make that work,
it has a ""real"" safety, no matter what Kratz thinks.

someone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial

I suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic.





By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned
physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down 
into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by
increasing intra-abdominal pressure....
Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only 
detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal. 
Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous
operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best
position to make that determination.

Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then 
folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far
too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.

402,2,0,628,Medical and Technical Discussions (13 vertices),"To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can ""hiccup"" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back.

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus

I am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it.  God's love 
is unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of 
rejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.

These verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He 
is opposed to evil.

I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship 
because of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting Christ.  

I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with 
putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel 
without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal.

Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are 
afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?"
406,10,0,816,Medical and Technical Discussions (13 vertices),"
I finished reading a very good book, ""The Will of God"", Weatherhead.
This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the
will of God.

Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts;
intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He
(Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael
Parkin above quite nicely.

Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will
is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with,
even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by
circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all
humankind) will never be stopped.

Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of
this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's
intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life
and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and
deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3)
Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the
Cross, as Jesus willingly (""not my will, Lord, but yours"") died for
the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant,
overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.


It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial
will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.



Right, intentional will.

There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which
are problematic.  It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling
to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing
the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is
God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go
by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.

Moreover, the phrase ""though I speak with the tongues of men and angels""
used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then
assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it
is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.

Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how
God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one
amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.

So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE
ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to 
justify jabbering.

But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.

Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at
verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright
fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post
seems like a ""friend of a friend"" thing.  And linguistically, a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no."

To me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used

all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and
not necessarily ""legitimate"" targets), then arranges for some unrelated

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These

allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without

Some will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don't know how much
the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the
tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way,
and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course.
I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only
started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed
(off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been.
I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew
*that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later
in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to
bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first
lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry
about proper handlebar technique.


I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during
the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student
would take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the
""you are a sack of potatoes"" passenger speech, the instructor would steer
the bike and make a general nuisance of himself. It was amusing to watch,
I'm just happy that it didn't happen to me."

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs
for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
Good instructions are included with the chokes.
If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

Dear Will,

I've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok.
I had a few thoughts!:

""Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead"" - James 2:17

Faith is both belief and action.
If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a
swimmer? and will people believe that I am?
Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a
Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to
God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!

In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6
v3 says ""We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands""
I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have
come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and
we cannot help but obey what He says.
I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing
us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically
produced in our lives.

Hope this helps."

It uses 80-bit keys and 32 rounds of scrambling, with a throughput of 16 Mbits per second. The chip takes a key K and message stream M as input, and produces two values: E[M; K], the encrypted message, and E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block. This output raises questions about bandwidth efficiency, the interaction of DES modes with the two-part output, and the chip's ability to validate the wiretap block. It's unclear if the chip checks the wiretap block or if it can be replaced, and whether this has been addressed by the NSA."

From this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smith
came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the
back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what
happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never
had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan
of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. 

It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie
at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting
in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of 
their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the 
goaltender, or whatever.

And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only
say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.
There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late
in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team

is made of 3/4"" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,
professionals can open it rather easily:

	1) Freeze a link.

	2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).

	3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are
		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.

	For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is
anywhere from 1/2"" to 7/8"" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type
locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat
in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8"" model).

	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.
Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.

Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation
in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this
approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook
the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_
(i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences.
The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have
to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case.
You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive
pellets or spread baits?

There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently,
because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor-
General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the
whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of
controlling the population is still considered to be controlled
shooting.


Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating
food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from
hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables
grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much 
freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or
the supermarket).


By ""cannot now be justified"" I guess you mean that you personally

I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a 
price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk
as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that
there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who
are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an 
Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that
Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus
no muslim is free from error. 



Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is
widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are
many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in
and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people
under the same name. 


The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true
that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of
many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings
precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come
to agreement about them.

Acupuncture needles vary in length and thickness, and solid needles are used in TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) to minimize tissue damage and external invasion.

It also discusses Pascal's Wager, a philosophical argument for believing in God, and its flaws, including the ""avoiding the wrong hell"" problem and the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely.

It discusses the complexity of the universe and the possibility of a causeless cause, as well as the Argument From Design, which claims that the presence of design in the universe proves the existence of God.

Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few
changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5.

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part
of the ISA bus.

The question I have is simple:
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does?

To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the
BALE line?

On a related note:
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name

The author recalls a letter battle in _Biblical Archaeology Review_ regarding a Franklin Mint ad featuring a doll with a head based on Nefertiti, sparking debate over her racial identity. The author argues that Western representations of Jesus vary but generally depict him with dark hair and a beard, common in Mediterranean regions. They also mention the ""Black Madonna"" and how its blackness is due to an accident rather than racial features. The discussion extends to the racial categorization of people from various regions, including Turks, Persians, Indians, Arabs, and Ethiopians, challenging the notion of whiteness and the potential identification of modern Jews as oppressors.

The author, Larry L. Overacker, responds to a previous comment by Simon, clarifying the distinction between true obedience, false obedience, disobedience, and schism. Overacker explains that obedience is not solely about compliance or refusal but also considers the nature of the commands given. He argues that the SSPX's resistance to certain Papal policies is a legitimate position according to Catholic theology, as they believe these policies contradict traditional teachings.

Overacker then addresses the Pope's excommunication of Archbishop Lefebvre and the SSPX bishops, which he finds confusing. He argues that the traditional theology of Holy Orders does not support the Pope's claim that episcopal consecration confers jurisdiction, which is necessary for a schismatic act. The author further criticizes the Pope's reasoning, stating that it is based on the occurrence of Vatican Council II and his position as Pope, rather than addressing Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns.

The text concludes by highlighting the ongoing dialogue between the SSPX and Rome, aiming to resolve the issues. Overacker warns against the potential destruction of the papacy's disciplinary power if the SSPX's position is not carefully considered, as it could set a precedent for ignoring papal decisions and claiming obedience through disobedience."

I would like to emulate this behavior in my application. It seems a

user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.

One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are
wrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the
right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to
check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his
impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later
he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of ""I will
be in you and you will be in me.""  (Again I cannot provide the exact
quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that
the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward
event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.
If you look for a person you will be deceived.

It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would
be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when
he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.
A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to
based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over
the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like
what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and
I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.

Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one
Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ
comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

Peace,
Will.

I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and
clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws.
I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email,
followup to t.p.g.

1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get
   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I
   was told by a police officer.
2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to
   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns
   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.
3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will
   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.
   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form
   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  
   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these
   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will
   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess
   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.
4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will
   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations
   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some 
   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.
   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)

Dyer, you're rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's
often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of
non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,
but it's still no more than a guess.
It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who don't respond.

There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many
diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology
sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have
run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental
method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine
doesn't have all the answers.

This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a
miracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got
out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several
studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing
inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are
discussed in ""Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]

But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be
picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In
the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the
studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the
_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed
layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are
consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of ""bad"" prostanoid
products to ""good"" prostanoid products could still be fairly ""bad.""
Isn't this ratio the issue?

What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA
supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs

As many people have mentioned, there is no reason why insurers could not

The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be
lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are
removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered
care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.

For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible
to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.  If you

p_c is the same distance from our four points, so
dist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4) 

Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:
distsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4) 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the

Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses

inherently in conflict.

Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only
recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.
The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been
implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of
the new window.


[...]

This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to
provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is
CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't
match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a
border-pixel, and the problem should go away.

There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that
CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to
XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines
CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so
you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib
implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm
not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)

601,100,0,580,"Sports, Tech, and Debates (17 vertices)","Several recent posts have identified the English word 'Easter' with
the Babylonian goddess 'Ishtar'.

'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar.
If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it.
But in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East'
and German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'.
Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'.
Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.

There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they
are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.

The options cover total expenditures for the station from 1994 to 1998 and include various costs such as development, operations, and research support. The committee must also consider program reserves to ensure the station is implemented within the budget. NASA has $4 billion reserved for new technology investment, so station options above $7 billion require corresponding reductions in other NASA programs. Gibbons announced that the US and its international partners will give full consideration to using Russian assets, including the expertise of Russian participants, in the redesign process to potentially reduce costs while preserving research capabilities.

much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G
range.


True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I
don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
risks involved.

If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures
100% of the available launch market, then I think you could
do it.

	Are there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why
my MR2's engine sounds noisy? The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, 
but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. 
	I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine
noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month

but more so during idling.

Initially, the Pilgrims attempted communal property ownership, where they shared work and crops, but this led to starvation and hardship. Governor Bradford then privatized the land, giving each family their own plot, which resulted in increased productivity and a better standard of living. The author argues that private property ownership is a more effective system, allowing people to get what they need to live a fulfilling life. They cite the Pilgrims' experience as evidence that communal ownership breeds confusion and discontent, and that private enterprise is a more suitable economic policy. The text concludes that private property allows society to flourish, while the alternative leads to poverty and dissatisfaction."

Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced
to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike
Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy
Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who
retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?
After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.
Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in
reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm
not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit
and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith
seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he
played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)

Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable
contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no
visible contrast bands.

To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,
etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these
frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote
directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.

Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?"

The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition.

Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem
to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising
to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling
anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two, you're
supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their
histories), regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction.  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things.

Most dogs do this out of playfulness rather than hostility, so it's recommended to slow down and then accelerate quickly to confuse and outrun them. However, for hostile or persistent dogs, a different approach is needed. It's crucial to never face off a dog on their territory but instead on neutral ground, like the road. By standing your ground, slowly advancing, and projecting an angry and dominant attitude, you can intimidate the dog and assert your dominance. Dogs can sense anger, and this may cause them to retreat to their territory, recognizing your dominance and avoiding punishment. Understanding dog behavior and presenting yourself as the dominant being can help manage these encounters safely."

The user assumes the DVM performs some form of integration and division by the wave period. However, when measuring a distorted square wave, the output value was significantly lower, causing confusion. The response clarifies that unless specified as an RMS reading, the DVM likely measures average voltage, and for non-sine waves, it may multiply the average by a correction factor applicable only to sine waves, leading to incorrect readings. True-RMS DVMs are required for accurate measurements of various waveforms.

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the

Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to ""turn it up a notch"" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an

Upon arrival in Sumgait, they found the city closed off and under military control, with tanks and armored personnel carriers on the streets. Bazian witnessed a burned-out car with its occupants incinerated, and heard shots being fired. He also saw a crowd of people led by a man with a megaphone, declaring the start of the Armenian-Azerbaijani war. Bazian managed to walk through the city and reach his home, where he found his children alive.

742,1,0,677,Technology and Diverse Topics (17 vertices),"I recently completed a challenging task of replacing the spring pack on my tall truck, which involved using various tools and techniques. The process required some smaller metric sockets and WD40 to undo the shocks, and I was able to use some SAE sockets as a close fit. I only needed to remove the U-bolts and shock absorbers, and by jacking up the frame, I could lift the spring free of the axle. I then soaked the nut with WD40 and removed it, flipped the bottom spring, and replaced the spring pack. This was a physically demanding task, and I needed a pipe cheater to help with the high torque spec of the U-bolt nuts. Reassembling the pack bolt was tricky, but I managed to use string to hold the pack together while aligning the pin. I also had to realign the axle to get the pin head into the hole in the lift block. The ride is now softer, and the truck sits level.

The timing of the eclipses is provided, with the possibility of a 30-minute delay according to an alternate ephemeris. The eclipses are expected to offer limited new insights about the rings themselves, but thermal observations during the July eclipse could provide valuable data on Iapetus' thermal properties, such as thermal inertia. Jay Goguen from JPL is particularly interested in thermal IR observations of the July 20th disappearance of Iapetus into Saturn's shadow and is willing to offer a personal grant of over $100 for the data. However, the timing of the event makes it challenging to observe, except from Russia or Ukraine, where large telescopes and 10 um instrumentation may be available. Jay emphasizes the difficulty of the observation, requiring a large telescope with good IR capabilities and suitable 10-20 um instrumentation, which may not be widely available at the ideal longitudes.

He emphasizes that the Jewish fighters provided a warning to the civilian population of Dir Yassin before the attack, urging them to evacuate to safety.

This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto

government will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become
the only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.

As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent
that except via Clipper, but ""cheap, secure crypto for everyone"" is a

Science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising.  One
aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses
resulting from the models produced by this thinking process.


Science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world.
It is objective.


Anything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example,
since we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which
affects our behaviour can be observed.  Science does not make any claims
about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the
physical world.


The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The
model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome
of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out
well defined observations which are objective.

Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and
the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the
moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world
existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a
*spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it
should be the currently accepted models.

The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the
correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The
arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this
cannot be said of scientists."

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I
came up with:
ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M
This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.
Quick summary of each commmand:
Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.
L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)
&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always on
S11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)

In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right
before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer 
function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra

In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed

I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in

on two of her comments.


One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning
about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,
scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of
evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the
back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be
filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a
grave mistake to confuse these.

Past snippets from this thread:



Back to Lee Lady:


These posters are making the mistake that I have previously
criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A ""carefully
designed and controlled study"" is neither always possible nor
always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a
remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we
have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind
of claim to ask for a ""carefully designed and controlled study""
to alleviate our skepticism.)

Rules such as ""support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and
controlled study"" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.
I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be
convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have
occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To
reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from
uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical
problems are notoriously problematic.)  "

Graphics workstations of a new 2D abstract artwork and animation package called 
Chance's Art.  The package will be described and demonstrated, and some of the 
technical issues will be discussed.  Marketing plans will be outlined.  The 
talk will also present some of the technical and business problems increasingly 
confronting small startup software companies today, and some of the 
opportunities this situation presents.

Time after the event will be allocated for hands-on demonstrations to 
interested parties.  Silicon Graphics is graciously providing an Indigo for 
this event.  Myck Kupka will also be demonstrating his computerized interactive 
reflective stereoscope, which is installed upstairs in the McLuhan Centre, so 
feel free to drop by for a demonstration before or after the event. BTW, be 
sure to sing ""Happy Birthday, Myck""...

The names of nominees for our Siggraph executive offices will be announced at

	Terrorism, as you would know if you had a spine that allowed
you to stand up, is random attacks on civilians.  Terorism includes
such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a

they are likely to be stabbed and killed, like a certain lawyer killed

You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess
is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in
political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as
agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.
At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to
Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt
to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters
will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law

Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?
From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
16-bit color, is that correct?

Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they
seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a

spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.

The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate 
onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh 
envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. 

You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. 
It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, 
the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. 
That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure 
stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions
(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make 
a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. 

The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur
does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the 
cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be 
done there........



The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it 
lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses 
for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they 
use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's 
do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems 
could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with 
providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill

However, the Law was primarily binding on Jews and not Gentiles, which the Church had to address after Jesus' death. Paul, on the other hand, suggests that the Law's purpose is to convict people of their sinfulness, but it has been superceded by Christ. He focuses on moral standards rather than ceremonial laws like circumcision and the Sabbath. While Jesus and Paul may seem to have differing views on the Law, they are actually discussing different aspects of it.

War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish
population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War.

""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall 
 see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are

 On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is

The author argues that Luke's genealogy is that of Joseph, Jesus's husband, as it traces Joseph's lineage back to David's son, Nathan. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Mary is not mentioned in Luke 3:23, and that Joseph is named as the husband of Mary in Matthew 1:16, indicating a connection to Joseph's lineage. The author also addresses the issue of Joseph's role in Jesus's conception, suggesting that the Holy Spirit could have employed Joseph's seed while ensuring Mary and Joseph remained unaware of any physical union. The text then introduces Rudolf Steiner's theory that the two genealogies refer to two different children who later converge as Jesus of Nazareth, an explanation that resolves the apparent contradictions while keeping the gospel texts intact. The discussion concludes by stating that whether or not Steiner's theory is accepted, it provides a resolution to the genealogy contradictions."

Contrary to what the ""Protocols of Zion crowd"" might suggest,
Judaism does not have any such goals.


The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer.
I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical
one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling
is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or
Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do.
With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights
in Israel as do all other Israelis.


Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think
you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their
supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my
knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,
as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens
of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli
citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find
themselves.

just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the
fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (""...nor shall any person .
. . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself..."").
Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be
civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection.
Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to
criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part
of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as 
to the location of the child--this is routine.  A ""computer crime"" 
prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense, 
where a suit by a party injured by ""hackers"" would not.  If I am accused, 
for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should 
protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however,
it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a ""crime"" in the
technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty
boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil
trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal
prosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how
