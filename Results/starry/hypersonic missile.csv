Very limited activities have been led by EADS France and SNECMA on this subject during the PREPHA program with basic test performed at ONERA. In the same time, EADS France developed a carbon/carbon hydrogen cooled injection strut, which has been successfully tested in CHAMOIS scramjet chamber. By another way, the cooperation led by EADS Aerospatiale Matra Missiles (EADS-AMM) and the Moscow Aviation Institute for developing a fully variable geometry dual mode ramjet was also an opportunity to acquire a large know-how in the field of fuel-cooled structures. Beyond these first steps, EADS-AMM and EADS Launch Vehicles (EADS-LV) are now working on the development of an innovative technology for fueledcooled combustor structures taking advantage of EADS-LV mastery of specific weaving process for manufacturing composite materials. By comparison with the « classical » technology of assembled cooled panels, this technology will allow to limit the connecting problems, improve the mechanical characteristics and reduce the mass and the cost. The PTAH-SOCAR technology was the subject of a first successful hot test in the MAI test facility. A followon experimental program should complete the demonstration of the fuel-cooled panel technology feasibility while a preliminary design of a PROMETHEE combustion chamber should allow to precisely evaluate its interest from the point of view of the system conception.

Introduction EADS Aerospatiale Matra Missiles (EADS-AMM) has been a major contributor, beside ONERA, to the National Research and Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion PREPHA (Ref[1]). Within the scope of this program, EADS-AMM acquired a first know-how in scramjet and dual-mode ramjet components design and hypersonic airbreathing vehicle system studies. On this base, the present activity, led in cooperation with ONERA, is mainly focused on the development of the dual mode ramjet technology (Ref[1] and [2]). From the point of view of materials, the major technological difficulty for the development of hypersonic airbreathing vehicles, powered by dualmode ramjet or scramjet, is to design and realize the structure of the combustion chamber. Indeed, the combustion chamber and the fuel injection and/or flame stabilization systems, possibly placed in the flow, must be able to sustain a rarely so severe thermomechanical environment. Moreover, it is possible that the operational use of the airbreathing propulsion on a very large range of Mach number (Mach 2 to Mach 8 for military application, at least Mach 2 to Mach 10 for space launcher application) will imply a variable geometry for the combustion chamber. It supposes to have on disposal structures with sufficiently controlled geometry to ensure tightness between movable and fixed surfaces of the chamber. By another way, working at high wall temperature limits the thermal loading, particularly during a high-speed cruise phase. That is very favorable for military application if we consider the limited cooling capacity of a hydrocarbon fuel even if it is endothermic. That is also very favorable for space launcher application (with hydrogen as fuel) for extending at the maximum the use of the installed airbreathing propulsion system. Finally, having large design margin allows to use relatively low cost cooling systems while ensuring good reliability and safety characteristics. c)2001 American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics or Published with Permission of Author(s) and/or Author(s)' Sponsoring Organization."

A drag reduction strategy has been proposed and investigated numerically in the current study, namely the combinational opposing jet and aerospike concept, and the influences of length-to-diameter ratio of aerospike and jet pressure ratio on the drag reduction mechanism have been evaluated. The predicted results have been compared with the available experimental data in order to validate the numerical approach, and the grid independency analysis has been conducted as well. The obtained results show that the numerical results show good agreement with the ground experimental data, and the grid scale has only a slight impact on the numerical results.

Boost phase interception is considered successful, when a complete destruction of the missile and its on board munitions is achieved. Various weapon systems have been developed for boost phase interception of ballistic missiles. This work is applied to one of these systems which is the ground-based intercept missile. The requirements for the interceptor effectiveness will be discussed. The work is based on simulated engagements between the attacking ballistic missile and the interceptor employing proportional navigation for the guidance law. The distance between the target missile warhead and the interceptor at the end of engagement, which is called the miss distance, is calculated as a measure of the interceptor performance. The effect of changing the navigation ratio on the acceleration requirement and the total flight time for the interceptor to attain minimum miss distance is illustrated.

By drawing on documents only recently declassified, he shows that one of President Kennedy's compromises with the Soviets involved the removal of Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, an arrangement concealed from both the American public and the rest of the NATO allies. Nash traces the entire history of the Jupiters and explores why the United States offered these nuclear missiles, which were capable of reaching targets in the Soviet Union, to its European allies after the launch of Sputnik. He argues that, despite their growing doubts, both Eisenhower and Kennedy proceeded with the deployment of the missiles because they felt that cancellation would seriously damage America's credibility with its allies and the Soviet Union.

The introduced approach is a modification of the well-known Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG) law. The IFG law enables the missile to approach a high maneuvering target while trying to minimize control effort as well as miss distance in a two-stage flight. In the first stage, while the missile is far from the intended target, the IFG tends to have low sensitivity to the target maneuvering seeking to minimize the overall control effort. When the missile gets closer to the target, a second stage is started and IFG law changes tactic by increasing that sensitivity attempting to minimize the miss distance. A Fuzzy-Switching Point (FSP) controller manages the transition between the two stages. The FSP is optimized based on variety of scenarios; some of which are discussed in the paper. The introduced scheme depends on line-of-sight angle rate, closing velocity, and target-missile relative range. The performance of the new IFG law is compared with other guidance laws.

The digital control system is open-loop and missile dynamics (pitch-rate-to-elevator) is assumed to be of second-order type. The square-wave input, corresponding to the elevator deflections, stabilizes system online output that is the rate of the line-of-sight (LOS) angle. The output stabilization results in two-point guidance-law to be actively realized, hence the missile approaches the target until a hit. The guidance strategy is open-loop (it doesn't require active homing), whereas the missile can hit dynamic targets moving uniformly on a linear pathway. Moreover, only the initial triggering of the missile is target-oriented and requires active target data, to be provided by a visual device at the launch stage where the missile is to be directly pointed towards the target before being fired. During the engagement, the missile is assumed to have constant roll-rate (obtained at launch stage) and also constant forward velocity. The missile is also slightly asymmetric due to actuating fins geometry. Moreover, it could be assumed almost symmetric hence the linear motion theory analysis is valid. Meanwhile, as long as the roll-rate is not close to the pitch natural frequency, the unwanted tricyclic motion is avoided and this is preferred. In the current study, and through the numerical simulations, the roll-rate is so much higher than the pitch-rate, hence normally, the Magnus-moment and its accompanied tricyclic motion are not present.

For this purpose, the governing equations of motion of a flexible guided missile are derived following the Lagrangian approach. The missile is idealized as a non-uniform beam where the bending elastic deflections are modelled using the method of modal substitution. The vehicle (time varying) bending modeshapes and natural frequencies are determined by modelling variable mass and stiffness distributions with thrust and mass burning effects accounted for. To solve this problem the missile is divided into several segments of uniform stiffness, density and axial force distribution. This approach produces a non-linear transcendental equation, which requires an iterative scheme to numerically determine the magnitude of the eigenvalues. Since inertial measuring units (IMU) also sense the local body vibrations, the mass and stiffness non-uniformities plus the thrust action on elastic missiles can potentially influence their measurements and thus must be properly accounted for in an aeroelastic simulation. It is noted that the thrust force reduces the vehicle natural frequency while mass consumption increases it. Thus the modal natural frequencies can either decrease or increase in time. Also the critical buckling thrust, which dynamically causes a zero natural frequency, is obtained and therefore the thrust instability limitations are determined through simulation. With proper modelling of the IMU vibrations effects and engine/thrust fluctuations, the influence of body vibrations on the missile dynamics and controls are investigated with axial thrust effect."

Nevertheless, performance, obtained with the provided technology level and with a fixed-geometry dual-mode ramjet, were not sufficient to allow the use of a landing gear sized to comply with full mass vehicle take-off requirements because of corresponding mass. Since 1993, AEROSPATIALE MATRA Missiles and the Moscow Aviation Institute have been developing the concept of a variable-geometry-dualmode-ramjet called Range and the associated technology demonstration. The considered engine has a fully variable internal geometry which gives it a priori a high performance level over the whole Mach number range. Technology development work led to the design and partial demonstration of materials and structures solutions to comply with the variable geometry requirements. These technologies should be definitively demonstrated thanks to the tests of a large scale prototype in AEROSPATIALE MATRA Missiles Bourges-Subdray Center (connected pipe test up to Mach 6.5 entrance of combustor 212x257 mm). A common work has been realized by AEROSPATIALE MATRAMISSILES and Moscow Aviation Institute to study the adaptation of the WRR engine concept to PREPHA-type generic vehicles. Taking into account the developed technologies, a detailed mass budget has been defined for the airbreathing propulsion system. A simplified but efficient methodology has been developed at AEROSPATIALE MATRAMISSILES to analyze the interest of several propulsion systems on a SSTO of PREPHA-type. WRR has then been compared with other propulsion systems. These results, enhanced year after year, have been presented at the previous Joint Propulsion Conferences in 1998 and in 1999. In particular, the use of a full-scale WRR should allow to design a generic vehicle of PREPHA class, but using a take-off gear, with a 450 tons take-off weight: this point was estimated as non possible for every other fixed engine model. During the current year of common work, studies have been again enhanced and significant technology has paved the way of consolidation of the capacity of realization of such Wide Range Ramjet engines. In particular, the new results from the paper studies give comparison of WRR propelled PREPHA-type vehicle with literature-available propulsion models and other technology assumptions for SSTO. A concern is also the methodology of incremental development and in particular scaling effect and more appropriate experimental vehicles and associated testing methodology. In parallel to these system studies, status of associated technology developmentis described.

The conservation form of the three-dimensional equations, written in generalized coordinates, are finite differenced and solved on a body-fitted curvilinear grid system developed in conjunction with the flowfield solver. The numerical procedure is based on an implicit approximate factorization algorithm employing a multi-grid approach in the simulation of flow about complex finned-missile configurations. The grid program is based on the method of algebraic interpolation and is capable of generating three-dimensional grid systems for missile bodies and finned-missiles having up to eight control surfaces. The multi-grid method improves the CPU time by as much as a factor of 40 over the conventional single-grid method. In addition, using the IBM's vectorizing and optimizing Fortran compiler, speeds up the total execution time (CPU) by more than 90 percent over the same code run on a non-vector architectured machine. The present method is applied to complete missile configurations in supersonic flow at high angles of attack. The predicted aerodynamic coefficients match the available wind-tunnel data with good accuracy. Flow nonlinearities such as shock and separation are detected and verified with the available experimental reports. Body vortex separation and classical patterns of vertical flow are also numerically obtained and examined for vortex interaction effects."

In this work, we have compared the aerodynamic characteristics of two missiles having the same crosssectional areas, but different shapes (one circular and one square with round corners). In order to differentiate the non-circularity and the fin effects, we have considered the bodies with no fins. A threedimensional, compressible, stationary, viscous, turbulent flow has been simulated using the FLUENT CFD code with the standard k-e model. The results have been compared with the existing benchmark data and with the data we obtained using DIGITAL DATCOM and MISSILE DATCOM softwares. Our results indicate that, even though the square section missile has more friction drag, it produces less overall drag. Also, its lift is higher than that of the circular case and thus has a higher aerodynamic efficiency. Moreover, the rate of increase of the aerodynamic efficiency with increasing of the angle of attack is higher than that of circular section."

The state variables in this problem may have three desirable behaviors, which are stability, asymptotically stability and even unstability. The proposed approach enables the missile to intercept a maneuverable target within a finite interception time which is less than existing approaches. Indeed, the main purpose of this paper is to decrease the interception time and it is shown that this new approach is realistic for missile guidance problems. Finally, the designed guidance law is simulated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for interception of maneuvering and non-maneuvering targets."
39,1,0,https://openalex.org/W2543117346,Advances in Missile Technology (42 vertices),"In this paper, a new guidance law, which is called virtual sliding target (VST) guidance law, is designed based on the concept of the virtual target (VT). The presented law is applicable for short- and medium-range missiles. It is shown that by using proportional navigation (PN) and considering the aerodynamic characteristics of the missiles, this law leads to a better performance than the PN law. In this approach, motion of the VT is started from a position higher than the real target. By controlling the speed of VT, which slides toward a predicted intercept point (PIP), speed, position, and trajectory of the missile can be controlled. Since arrival times of the missile to the VT and the VT to the real target are equal, the collision will happen. Furthermore, a new optimal guidance law is presented for long-range missiles based on the concept of the waypoint (WP) and VT. In the mentioned law, there are two important points. The first one is a constant point that is called a waypoint and the second one is called a virtual target, which slides toward the PIP. Then a teaching-learning–based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is used to find the optimal initial position of the WP and the VT to maximize the intercept speed. Simulation results illustrate better performance of the VST law over the PN law in terms of the intercept speed."

41,1,0,https://openalex.org/W2019625328,Advances in Missile Technology (42 vertices),"Most existing missiles are guided by proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law, but PNG is a particular case for LQ guidance rule with two main assumptions of small line-of-sight angles and negligible acceleration along the line-of-sight. However, most missile engagements exceed these limits because of high tangential and normal accelerations. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the feedback guidance law for non-linear systems such as homing missiles in real-time. We use artificial neural networks to synthesize feedback laws for homing missiles with non-linear state equations. We first obtain an open-loop optimal numerical solution for non-linear state equations and then use these data to train a feed-forward multilayer neural network in an off-line session. The network is then used effectively in a real-time for feedback guidance method. Simulation results show that this neural networks guidance method can efficiently produce an optimal feedback law in spite of relatively simple network architecture.

The three-dimensional (3-D) guidance laws are developed in a quite simple formulation that consists of a PN component for target capture and a coordination component for simultaneous arrival. The centralized algorithms come into effect when the global information of time-to-go estimation is obtained, whereas the decentralized algorithms have better performance when each missile can only collect information from neighbors. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed coordination algorithms are feasible to perform the cooperative engagement of multiple missiles against both stationary and maneuvering targets. The effectiveness of the 3-D guidance laws is also discussed."

Fixed convergence time estimation is achieved independent of initial conditions of the differentiation errors. The corresponding convergence/settling times are estimated. The finite- and fixed-time HOSM differentiators' performance is compared against the Levant recursive one via a hypersonic missile control simulation case study during the missile's terminal phase of flight. A continuous adaptive HOSM control is utilized. The double-layer adaptive algorithm is based on an equivalent control concept and does not allow overestimation of the control gains that mitigates control chattering. The robustness and high-accuracy output tracking in the presence of matched and unmatched external disturbances and missile model uncertainties is demonstrated for both the differentiators and the controller.

The data were extracted from a database that was constructed by the army staff headquarters based on daily reports of Iranian army units during the war.Over a period of eight years (1980-1988), Iraqi army fired 533 ballistic missiles at Iranian territories. From those, 414 missiles (77.7%) landed on Iranian cities. The impacts of these missiles caused the deaths of 2,312 civilians and injured 11,625 others. Three types of ballistic missiles were used: FROG-7, Scud, and Al-Hussein (a modified version of the Scud missile). Twenty-seven cities in Iran were struck by Iraqi ballistic missiles. The highest mortalities from ballistic missiles were in Dezful and Tehran.

Eighty-six missiles landed in populated areas. During Iraqi missile attacks, 422 civilians died and 1 579 injured (4.9 deaths and 18.3 injuries per missile). During 52 days, 8.1 of the civilians died and 30.4 injured daily. Of the cases that died, 101 persons (24%) were excluded due to the lack of information.

The article analyzes the specifics of this threat, examines related doctrinal and practical changes, describes and characterizes planned defense architecture, forecasts the prospects for its implementation and impact on the strategic situation. The author comes to a conclusion that the U.S. – planned counter-hypersonic capabilities are aimed at countering the threat posed by intermediate-range and shorter-range boost-glide systems. Development of these capabilities is concentrated in three main domains: sensors, interceptors and advanced technologies. The most important and challenging goal of this development will be to ensure an effective integration and coordinated joint functioning of all the elements to be created within a unified command, control and communication system. The key driving force for the development of the U.S. counter-hypersonic capabilities is China. This conclusion follows not only from the fact that the PRC is currently the only state with boost-glide systems of less-than-intercontinental range in its arsenal, but also from the fact that future interceptors will be based on maritime platforms. By adapting its missile defense policy, the U.S. are clearly looking for opportunities to enhance its conventional deterrence capability against China in the context of increasing tensions in Asia-Pacific. The ongoing “hypersonic” evolution of the American missile defense will complicate arms control measures in this area. The integration of various elements of the emerging system implies building its architecture in such a way that limitations could have a major impact on its effectiveness. This could become a fundamental obstacle on the way to agreeing on measures to limit missile defenses in the future. Such situation may leave only some room for confidence-building measures capable of providing a certain level of transparency and predictability."

The U. S. missile defense policy can be roughly divided into three components: homeland missile defense, regional missile defense, and advanced developments related to these both parts. Conclusions are made about the prospects of missile defense policy, taking into account such factors as the views of experts from think tanks close to the Democratic Party, funding of programs, and measures taken in the field of missile defense. The development of the homeland missile defense systems faces technological challenges which create uncertainty about the whole architecture. Regional missile defense systems are going to be platforms for development of systems to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons. The National Space Defense Architecture is planned to include layers which are supposed to be part of homeland and regional defenses. The main obstacles to these programs are the position of Democratic members of the U. S. Congress, an urgent need for funds for recovery of the national economy after the COVID&amp;#8209;19 pandemic, and other defense policy priorities (e. g., nuclear modernization). In connection with these findings, the author presents an overview of options of a missile defense deal between Russia and the United States as part of the arms control regime. Although every option has its disadvantages and potential obstacles, a bilateral executive agreement on transparency in missile defense seems to be the most feasible option."

Radiation with p -polarization allows for a more expressive topological scattering pattern than in the case of s -polarization, and the θ angle change of the place gives a brighter relief pattern with alternating maxima and deep minima, which leads to an assumption about a high resolving power when identifying the objects by means of the gradient method.

However, the 2019 Missile Defense Review (MDR) emphasized the role of the TMD systems in the regional deterrence of the Russian Federation and China. So far this issue has received little attention and this paper aims to fill that gap. The first section identifies the key points of the MDR concerning the capabilities of regional missile defense for regional deterrence of the major nuclear powers. The author also examines the views of different represen- tatives of the US Department of Defense on this issue, and concludes that the US military-political leadership has a generally positive assessment of the capabilities of the TMD systems to contain Russia and China in case of a regional crisis. In particular, planners emphasize the role of the regional missile defense in countering the ‘anti-access/access-denial’ capabilities and the concept of ‘escalate to de-escalate’ ascribed to Russia. At the same time, US policymakers express in that regard serious concerns about Russia’s and China’s progress in the development of hypersonic missile systems. The second section examines the ongoing debates in Western expert so- ciety on the role of the regional missile defense in terms of deterring Russia and China. The author concludes that in this respect experts can provisionally be divided into two groups. The first group generally supports the arguments of the US military-political leadership and is optimistic about TMD capabili- ties for regional deterrence of Russia and China. The second group is more critical of these capabilities. They point out the lack of accurate data on the combat capabilities of such systems in active warfare and criticize question- able theoretical assumptions of their opponents. The third section provides a critical analysis of the arguments presented in this debate. The author concludes that the current concepts of deterrence based on the use of regional missile defense systems do not fully address possible implications for regional security and strategic stability. The Russian Federation and China possess significant nuclear arsenals, which already make nuclear escalation involving these countries and the United States possible. Adding yet another variable (TMD) into this equation only aggravates the situation."

Noting that the documents do not use the term &amp;quot;threat&amp;quot; in China&amp;apos;s assessment, the author concludes that Japan takes a more cautious position than the United States, trying not to be drawn into a confrontation between superpowers. As for Russia, the greatest alarmism is expressed not in relation to its policy as such, but in relation to its potential blocking with China on an anti—Japanese basis — the main &amp;quot;nightmare&amp;quot; for Tokyo. The article considers the issue of the &amp;quot;counter-offensive&amp;quot; missile potential provided for by the new strategy, which would allow Japan to strike at the enemy from a remote distance in the event of a direct threat to its security. The acquisition of such a potential has become particularly relevant for Japan in connection with the development of missile technologies of neighboring &amp;quot;hostile&amp;quot; countries — the DPRK and the PRC, as well as the general progress of missile weapons in the world, including the hypersonic ones.

57,50,1,https://openalex.org/W2906650205,Missile Defense System Development (50 vertices),"The view of both Moscow and Washington on ballistic missile defense (BMD) for a long time rested on the principle, formulated in the late 1960s, which held that anti-missile systems for defense of the territories were destabilizing, therefore limiting them would strengthen strategic stability. Since that time the USSR and then Russia always adhered to this principle, while the US at times rejected it (i.e. the SDI program of the 1980s) and by now has finally given it up altogether. Meanwhile , the majority of the independent leading experts assess the chances of the existing US missile defense to tangibly affect Russia’s nuclear strike capability as extremely low. However, the US unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002 seriously undermined political trust between Moscow and Washington. The unwillingness of the US to provide Russia with a legally binding commitment not to direct its BMD system against it (including technical constraints) contributes to the problem. In addition, the US missile defense system is being built as an open-ended system with no future restrictions on its expansion and improvement. Russia has responded to the creation of the US national missile defense system with the modernization of its strategic nuclear forces and initiation of its own Air-Space Defense (ASD) system. The difference of the concepts of the BMD system development in the United States and the ASD system in Russia lies in that the US system is intended to defend against limited attacks of intercontinental ballistic missiles against the North American continent or of medium-range missiles against the US allies in Europe and the Pacific region. The Russian ASD is a multilayered system designed to protect against a protracted air-space of-fensive by the US/NATO involving high-precision conventional weapons (including future hypersonic and space-based systems) and limited use of nuclear weapons. Although there has been a long break in a meaning ful US-Russian dialogue on missile defense, it is still possible to reach some positive agreements. If the US and Russia resume negotiations on limitation and reduction of strategic offensive arms, it might open a window for a compromise on missile defense. Such a compromise can be based on an agreed threshold separating, on the one hand, missile defense systems that can significantly affect strategic stability by in-tercepting a large number of US or Russian ICBMs and SLBMs and, on the other hand – systems that will allow the US and Russia to protect their territories against at-tacks by third states or rogue regimes and would thus strengthen their mutual security. The first class of BMD systems would be subject to restrictions, while the second one would be given a green light. Moreover, in the second case there would reemerge an opportunity of the development of a joint defense systems of the two powers, which was declared in 2002 but never came true."

Simulation and calculation methods are proposed for estimating the accuracy of target designation in terms of the observation angle and the range and speed of the target taking into account both the errors in measuring the target and missile coordinates by a ground radar system and the relative position of the missile. The influence of the errors in measuring the target and missile coordinates and the relative position of the missile on the target designation accuracy is investigated. The problem of tracing the optimal trajectory of missile guidance to the target is formulated taking into account the errors of target designation to an onboard radar station and other factors.

The major threat to international security is the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. The United States and the former Soviet Union made huge efforts to reduce and limit offensive arms. However, presently the proliferation of ballistic missiles spreads all over the world, especially in the Middle East, because of the ballistic missile technology falling into the hands of hostile non-state groups. Missile defenses can provide a permanent presence in a region and discourage adversaries from believing they can use ballistic missiles to coerce or intimidate the U.S. or its allies. With the possible attack regional missile defense systems will be promptly mobilized to enhance an effective deterrent. The ultimate goal of such large-scale missile defense deployment is to convince the adversaries that the use of ballistic missiles is useless in military terms and that any attack on the United States and its allies is doomed to failure. The United States has missile defense cooperative programs with a number of allies, including United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, Italy and many others. The Missile Defense Agency also actively participates in NATO activities to maximize opportunities to develop an integrated NATO ballistic missile defense capability. The initiative of the development of US BMD naturally belongs to the United States. That country has enormous technological, financial, economic, military and institutional capabilities, exceeding by far those of the other NATO members combined."

With an aim test Mach 6.5 objective, the successful launch was conducted at the Sary Shagan test range in central Kazakstan on February 12, 1998. Ground-launch, rocket boosted by a modified Russian SA5 missile, the redesigned scramjet was accelerated to a new maximum velocity greater than Mach 6.4. This launch allowed for the measurement of the fully supersonic combustion mode under actual flight conditions. The primary program objective was the flight-to-ground correlation of measured data with preflight analysis and wind-tunnel tests in Russia and potentially in the United States. This paper describes the development and objectives of the program as well as the technical details of the scramjet and SA5 redesign to achieve the Mach 6.5 aim test condition.

Evidently, the initiative of creation of a missile defense in Europe surely belongs to the USA. Washington has enormous technological, financial, economic, military and institutional capabilities in the field of a missile defense, exceeding by far other NATO member-states. In February 2010, the President of the United States B. Obama adopted a project ""European Phased Adaptive Approach"" (EPAA) as an alternative to G. Bush's global strategic missile defense plan. The first two stages of the Phased Adaptive Approach are focused on creating a system capable of intercepting small, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The possibility of intercepting long-range missiles is postponed to the third (2018) and forth phases (2020). Moscow finds especially troublesome the third and the fourth phases of Washington's project of creating a European segment of the global antiballistic missile system, considering prospective capabilities of the U.S. interceptor missiles 61 and the envisioned areas of their deployment. The U.S. counter-evidence is that phase four interceptors do not exist yet.

In particular, we present models for the 1,000 kilometer‐range Nodong missile and a 1,300 kilometer‐range variant, both based on Scud technology. These models are single‐stage missiles with four clustered Scud‐engines and would have a circular error probable (CEP) of two to four kilometers or larger. We conclude that a 1,000 kilometer‐range missile with a one tonne payload could be built using Scud technology. Moreover, it appears feasible to extend the range to roughly 1,300 kilometers (with the same payload) if the missile body can be constructed out of high‐strength aluminum rather than steel, although it is unclear whether North Korea has such a capability. If both missiles are based on Scud technology, their existence would not imply a breakthrough in North Korean missile technology. These missiles would then represent essentially the longest‐range missiles achievable without technically difficult steps such as multi‐staging, suggesting that future range increases may occur more slowly than past increases, depending on the level of technical assistance North Korea can acquire. We look briefly at what ranges could be achieved using a two‐stage model with Scud engines and the difficulties a missile such as the Nodong would present to endo‐atmospheric missile defenses."

First and foremost, missile defense systems have been used in conventional armed conflicts. This practice has already demonstrated their combat effectiveness which has become an impetus for the ongoing technical modernization of their main elements. In recent years, the conflict scenarios have been worked out in the United States and Russia where the limited use of low-yield nuclear weapons is allowed. The limited nuclear strike can be launched at the initial stages of a traditional conflict to consolidate the acquired military benefits and disrupt the enemy’s counteroffensive. Obviously, the limited use of nuclear weapons is fraught with an aggravation of the risk of a rapid and uncontrolled nuclear escalation. Unexpectedly, in this context, missile defense becomes a severe deterrent. Missile defense systems deployed at critical military facilities can remove the incentives for the limited nuclear strike as well as give considerable strategic and political advantages. Under these circumstances, missile defense systems become key players in the military balance. To reduce the risks of the limited use of nuclear weapons the author proposes “a roadmap” based on revitalization of the main arms control regimes and use of the capabilities of modern missile defense systems. It is hypothesized that “thin” missile defense removes the incentive to launch the first limited nuclear strike, thus enhancing strategic stability."

In 2009, the U. S. President Baraсk Obama declared a start of the NATO missile defense system construction with a goal to be able to intercept a limited nuclear strike from Iran. Russia is in doubt about the stated purpose of the European missile defense and considers it to be a threat to its own strategic nuclear forces. The European missile defense construction has been experiencing technical obstacles and political difficulties: the cancellation of deployment of interceptor SM&amp;#8209;3 IIB and delays in establishing operational capability of the Aegis Ashore land-based missile defense system in Poland. The current architecture of the NATO missile defense, which allows only to intercept a limited number of incoming warheads, has no significant impact on Russian retaliatory strike capability. Nevertheless, the missile defense in Europe remains an irritating factor in relations between Russia and the USA.

At the same time, the impact of regional missile defense (theater missile defense) on regional security remains largely unexplored. The US and NATO leadership continue to claim that Russia has deployed intermediate-range missiles in the European part of the country. As a response to this step, in addition to other measures of regional deterrence towards Russia, it is planned to strengthen NATO’s regional missile defense system. The purpose of this article is to determine the potential impact of enhancing NATO’s theater missile defense on regional security. The answer to this question is important for understanding the prospects for European security. This article provides a critical analysis of Western experts’ scenarios of actions of Russia and NATO around the Baltic countries the place and role of theater missile defense in these scenarios and compares the doctrinal guidelines of the United States and Russia regarding regional nonnuclear deterrence. There are situations in which NATO’s enhanced regional missile defense could strengthen regional deterrence, and there are situations where this is less likely. Taking into account the doctrinal guidelines of both sides, conclusions are drawn about the destabilizing potential of NATO’s regional missile defense enhancement and that, in strengthening regional stability, there is no alternative to arms control and transparency regimes."

The latter authorized the deployment of a national missile defense system. Analyzing this process, the authors use a comprehensive approach and consider the US missile defense policy not only as a result of changed international security environment, but also in the context of the gradual transformation of the US domestic politics after the end of the Cold War. The authors conclude that by the end of the 1990s, the key prerequisite for the decision to deploy the national missile defense system was not a qualitative deterioration of the international security environment, but rather the internal political victory of the Republicans over the Democrats for the opportunity to form national defense and security agenda."

The agreement was the first turn in the U.S. policy in this area, determining the direction and content of missile defense development programs for many years to come. Once every ten years, the United States revised its policy, for instance, R. Reagan’s intention in 1983 to build a large-scale space-based missile defense system was seen as an attempt to move away from the concept of mutual nuclear deterrence, enshrined in the ABM Treaty. However, only after its withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002, the United States set a course for the deployment of a missile defense system in Europe, as stated, to protect the region from nuclear missile threats from “rogue states”. At the present stage, the growing degradation of relations between Russia and Western countries, especially against the backdrop of hostilities in Ukraine, has led NATO states to put forward new approaches to the integration of missile defense and air defense systems, providing for the functional interface of information management systems and strike components for the successful interception of different classes of targets. The experience of providing Ukraine with integrated defense and its functioning on the basis of modern Western air defense systems will allow the U.S. / NATO to evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen approach and apply the knowledge gained to improve Europe’s “anti-missile umbrella”.

Academic literature offers two perspectives on the prospects of their impact on the military-strategic situation. One approach tends to position hypersonic weapons as a revolutionary technology, while the other proceeds from the premise that hypersonic strike systems represent an evolutionary development of offensive systems. The objective of this article is to establish the specifics and limits of the hypersonic weapons impact on the existing military-strategic balance. The paper analyzes the problem of hypersonic weapons classification, their role and place in military strategy, as well as the evolution and prospects of the Russian, U.S. and Chinese programs on hypersonic weapons. The authors conclude that the advantages of hypersonic weapons cannot automatically be transformed into a guaranteed success amid a full-scale military conflict and are largely available to other strike systems based on less advanced technological solutions. The key scenario, where the benefits of hypersonic weapons can be realized the most, is a limited conflict, in which they are used for the surprise defeat of highly-protected priority targets and the establishment of theater domination. This is evidenced by the hypersonic development programs of the leading military powers – Russia, the United States, and China, – each of which is more or less committed to developing medium- and short-range systems. The implications of the unfolding hypersonic arms race for strategic stability are ambiguous. On the one hand, forward deployment of such systems increases the risks of escalation; reduced flight time to enemy strategic infrastructure facilities encourages the adversary to adopt more aggressive retaliation postures based on the principle of launch-on-warning rather than post-attack. On the other hand, the possession of hypersonic weapons by both sides in the same theater increases their mutual vulnerability and can thus play a stabilizing role."

The threat posed by two countries to the United States and their allies’ armed forces deployed in various regions has been the main incentive for the development of regional missile defense (theater missile defense) programs for more than 20 years. All this time, there has been an ongoing debate among American politicians, strategists, and academic experts on the prospects and specifics of the regional missile defense architectures, levels of U.S. allies’ participation in their development, as well as the very need to deploy these systems in North-East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The paper attempts to summarize and analyze the arguments of both the proponents and opponents of the idea to use the regional missile defense systems in the regional deterrence of North Korea and Iran.The first section examines approaches of different U.S. administrations to this issue. The author emphasizes that the Biden administration officials have already confirmed most of the basic postulates formulated by the Trump administration on the matter. According to them, the high efficiency of regional missile defense facilitates regional deterrence of the DPRK and Iran.The second section examines debates in the U.S. expert community. The author identifies two main approaches. The first basically repeats the arguments of the U.S. administration on the benefits of regional missile defense for regional stability. According to the second approach, the regional missile defense may destabilize the situation in the region without enhancing the protection of the U.S. and their allies’ armed forces.The third section provides a critical analysis of the debate. The author concludes that the arguments and assessments of both the opponents and proponents of the deterrence of the DPRK and Iran by means of regional missile defense are theoretically ill-founded and often one-sided.

Unlike other studies that focus on the importance of Iran’s missile program in providing deterrence for the country and establishing a balance of military power in the region, or that view the missile program as one of dozens of post-revolutionary contentious issues between Iran and the United States, this article looks into Iran’s ontological security. The paper primarily argues that the missile program has become a source of pride for Iranians, inextricably linked to their identity. As a result, the Iranian authorities face two challenges when it comes to sitting at the negotiation table with their Western counterparts: deep mistrust of the West, and the ensuing sense of shame over any deal on the missile issue. Thus, Iranian officials opted to preserve the identity components of the program, return to normal and daily routines of life, insist on the missile program’s continuation despite sanctions and threats, and emphasize the dignity and honor of having a missile program. The article empirically demonstrates how states can overcome feelings of shame and mistrust. It also theoretically proves that when physical security conflicts with ontological security, governments prefer the former over the latter, based on the history of Iran’s nuclear negotiations.

It is argued that NATO is incrementally increasing the strength and reach of its missile defence components, while rejecting any international treaty to regulate and limit their future expansion. This corresponds with a strategy of achieving invulnerability through counterforce and utilising NATO as an ‘insurance policy’ against Russia, to be activated when conflicts arise.

The author seeks to fill this gap, arguing that the emergence of new weapons has a negative impact on international stability, and this effect is weakly related to the specific characteristics of underline technologies. The theory of technological uncertainty offers an alternative to the offense-defense balance theory. The latter developed since the 1970s, but its validity is questionable. The theory of technological uncertainty attributes the destabilizing effect of weapons to the divergence of states' perceptions of the balance of powers, to the hyped expectations regarding the ability to compensate quantitative limitations with qualitative superiority, to the alarmistic sense of closing windows of opportunities and growing vulnerabilities. The article tests the theory against the historical record of military clashes in Europe from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries, as well as the crises between superpowers during the Cold War. The empirical cases are selected in order to cover the period marked by the intensification of qualitative arms races between states. In addition, it is also the period most often used to substantiate the offense-defense balance theory. The history of the last two and a half centuries provides a solid foundation for the theory of technological uncertainty. All instances of large-scale military clashes were preceded by significant technological changes, while peace fell on periods of technological stagnation. The author addresses the policy implications of the theory for the discussions on emerging weapons in the 2010s and 2020s. The study confirms that concerns regarding their destabilizing effect are justified, but for the different reasons from those put forward by most analysts. A somewhat optimistic caveat to its conclusions is the fact that currently emerging weapons are at various stages of development. The greatest likelihood of military clashes corresponds to the overlap of several technological uncertainties. Therefore, an increase in the time lag between introduction of various arms can mitigate destabilizing effect."

These difficulties are primarily connected with the committing crimes by representatives of the opposing side of the armed conflict, their obstruction of the activities of military justice bodies, including by mining the area, the use of small arms, mortar and missile-artillery weapons, the presence of significant casualties and destruction, which generally complicates the examination of the scene. The analysis carried out by the author makes it possible to propose scientifically grounded recommendations for the examination of the crime scene in areas of an armed conflict when investigating war crimes committed by the opposing side of an armed conflict using missile-artillery and aerial missile-bomb weapons, which will help to significantly minimize the consequences of these factors and in general, to increase the efficiency of the inspection of the places of incidents in the areas of armed conflict."
93,1,0,https://openalex.org/W3140092228,Missile Defense System Development (50 vertices),The article considers methods of solving the target allocation problem in surface-to-air missile systems for missile defence. Important specifics of the problem in question are rapid nature of anti-missile combat and the requirement for target illumination during homing. The control methods suggested make it possible to increase the efficiency of solving the target allocation problem by means of using prior data on target engagement probability and radar load estimation in the neighbourhood of future position points at the fire planning stage
94,75,0,https://openalex.org/W1532346264,Missile Defense System Development (50 vertices),"To a big extent the Russian defense policy and, as a consequence, development of the Russian defense industrial complex, is determined by the prospects of the US missile defense policy and fate of the US-Russia negotiations in this area. As a cooperative solution seems improbable in the observable future, Russia plans to develop certain response measures of military nature, including creation of a new heavy ICBM, and to create its own missile defense by 2015. However, this policy does not seem correct from the economic, political and security viewpoints. Russia overestimates the possible military challenges of the hypothetic US missile defense system and invests huge funds into fighting non-existent threats. A US-Russia cooperation in missile defense is possible, and it would fundamentally change their overall relations for the better."

At present, a multipolarity of interests and opinions is competing to set government policy. Russia must recognize the extent of the threats posed to it by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems. The Russian position on U.S. counterproliferation policies is still fairly reactive in nature, especially with respect to revision of the Anti‐Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. The 1995–96 elections may introduce considerable changes in Russian politics and policies relating to proliferation."

Feasibility and limitations of the panel method in missile aerodynamic modelling are then assessed based on comparison of computational and experimental results. An effort is made to extend the range of applicability of the panel method to moderate angles of attack by modelling separated vortices. Results show that non-linear aerodynamic characteristics of conventional missile configurations can be predicted within preliminary design accuracy at low to moderate angles of attack.
