Fields of concentrations, pressure, and temperature are calculated with the use of two-dimensional computational model based on non-stationary system of NavierStokes equations, energy conservation and diffusion equations together with system of chemical kinetic equations. Based on them, the fields of spectral optical properties and thermal radiation of the gas mixture within a scramjet combustor are computed. The density of the radiative heat flux to the chamber wall is computed by an approximation of the plane layer. Several fuels and corresponding chemical kinetics models are considered. These are: H2, CH4, C2H6, kerosene. Combustion of H2-air mixture is considered with the purpose of comparisons with calculation data of H.F.Nelson (Nelson, H.F., “Radiative Heating in Scramjet combustor,” J. Thermophysics and Heat Transfer, Vol. 11, No.1, 1997) and I.Boid et al. (Crow A., Boyd I., Terrapon V., “Radiation Modeling of a Hydrogen-Fueled Scramjet,” AIAA 2011-3769. 2011. 15 p.). It has been shown that some regimes of burning are non-stationary, and the radiative heat flux contributes significantly to the total heating of the combustor wall. Comparison of radiation heat fluxes for different initial conditions are presented."

Flame stabilization is achieved in the recirculation zone developing due to sudden expansion behind the inlet. Previous experimental and theoretical works suggest that there exists an optimum range of length-to-diameter ratios for the flame holder. However, due to fuel burnout the channel and flame holder geometry change in the process of scramjet operation, the regression rate being variable both in time and length. The purpose of this work is to develop a computational model of a solid-fuel scramjet taking into account the geometry variation, as well as to obtain typical flow patterns at the different stages of combustion. The numerical model is based on a system of fully compressible RANS equations with k-epsilon turbulence model.

5,95,30,https://openalex.org/W3135143354,Overview of Scramjet Engines (40 vertices),"The accurate parameter prediction of a flow field is of practical significance to promote the development of hypersonic flight. Velocity field prediction using deep learning is a promising method to provide an accurate velocity field in a scramjet isolator. A new approach for the velocity field prediction in a scramjet isolator is developed in this study. A data-driven model is proposed for the prediction of the velocity field in a scramjet isolator by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using measurements of the pressure on the isolator. Numerical simulations of flow in a three-dimensional scramjet isolator at various Mach numbers and backpressures are carried out to establish the dataset capturing the flow mechanism over various operating conditions. A CNN architecture composed of multiple reconstruction modules and feature extraction modules is designed. The CNN is trained using the computational fluid dynamics dataset to establish the mapping relationship between the wall pressure on the isolator and the velocity field in the isolator. The trained model is then tested over various Mach numbers and backpressures. The data-driven model successfully learns the relationship between the velocity field and pressure experienced on the wall of the isolator, i.e., the trained CNN model successfully reconstructed the velocity field based on the wall pressure on the isolator with high accuracy."

8,1,60,https://openalex.org/W2074886477,Overview of Scramjet Engines (40 vertices),NASA has contracted with the Central Institute of Aviation Motors CIAM to perform a flight test and ground test and provide a scramjet engine for ground test in the United States. The objective of this contract is to obtain ground to flight correlation for a supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) engine operating point at a Mach number of 6.5. This paper presents results from a flow path performance and thermal evaluation performed on the design proposed by the CIAM. This study shows that the engine will perform in the scramjet mode for stoichiometric operation at a flight Mach number of 6.5. Thermal assessment of the structure indicates that the combustor cooling liner will provide adequate cooling for a Mach number of 6.5 test condition and that optional material proposed by CIAM for the cowl leading-edge design are required to allow operation with or without a type IV shock-shock interaction.

This rocket-boosted, captive-carry test of the axisymmetric engine reached the highest Mach number of any scramjet engine flight test to date. The flight test and the accompanying ground test program, conducted in a CIAM test facility near Moscow, were performed under a NASA contract administered by the Dryden Flight Research Center with technical assistance from the Langley Research Center. Analysis of the flight and ground data by both CIAM and NASA resulted in the following preliminary conclusions. An unexpected control sensor reading caused non-optimal fueling of the engine, and flowpath modifications added to the engine inlet during manufacture caused markedly reduced inlet performance. Both of these factors appear to have contributed to the dual-mode scramjet engine operating primarily in a subsonic combustion mode. At the maximum Mach number test point, combustion caused transition from supersonic flow at the fuel injector station to primarily subsonic flow in the combustor. Ground test data were obtained at similar conditions to the flight test, allowing for a meaningful comparison between the ground and flight data. The results of this comparison indicate that the differences in engine performance are small."

In addition, the aerodynamic contraction ratio of the engine flow path varies significantly with flight speed, which must be accomplished by integrated inlet-isolator-combustor with a tailored fuel injection. The intensive activities for developing scramjet propulsive systems have been sustained for more than six decades, but the design and analysis process by modeling and simulation technique still requires improvement. For this reason, the present effort is summarizing and sharing the experimental data base developed in USA, Russia, China, Germany, Australia, France and Japan for studying the scramjet. In the present review, the pioneering supersonic combustion testing is presented first. Then all data are divided into groups according to the key components of scramjet for inlet-isolator, combustor either with step, cavity, or throttle, as well as, the fuel injector through wall or from a pylon. The collected entire data base includes a brief description of the geometric configurations, data measured, and testing conditions as a function of Mach number, temperature, pressure, and fuel mixture. The theoretical and the computational simulations directly related to the experiment are also included. We emphasize that the main attention in this review is given to model experiments; therefore, first of all, this review can be useful for engineers and scientists who are using numerical simulation of the thermo-gasdynamics of combustion processes for the purpose of validating the developing computer codes and kinetic models. The validation problem is also important in obtaining new experimental data for the conditions of experiments already performed, which undoubtedly raises the reliability and value of model experiments, which in the case of a multiple repetition of the results by different experimenters groups can be attributed as the ""canonical"" experiments or the benchmark tests."

Effective flame stabilization is required in supersonic combustors to complete the process, including rapid mixing, continuous ignition, and stable combustion, of generating thrust in a short resident time of milliseconds order. Due to the complex flow conditions in the supersonic combustor, it is difficult to achieve efficient flame stabilization, therefore, an efficient fuel injector and flame holder are required.

The whole cooling channel is divided into noncracking and cracking zones, and only the noncracking zone is studied in this paper. The simulation results indicate that heat transfer deterioration occurs very easily in scramjet engine cooling channels due to its small fuel mass flux, relatively high wall heat flux, and near-critical operating pressure. Increasing the channel aspect ratio is not always beneficial for reducing the wall temperature because of thermal stratification, and there exists an optimum value below 8 to make the wall temperature lowest. In addition, increasing the channel aspect ratio will reduce the thermal diffusion coefficient, resulting in a stronger thermal stratification and making the utilization of chemical heat sink and heat transfer design in the cracking zone of the cooling channel much more difficult. At last, a high operating pressure can alleviate the heat transfer deterioration, but it is not a good choice because of the heavier thermal stratification it brings and limited improvement in lowering the optimum wall temperature."

The effect of the preheater combustion was analyzed by varying between a flame mode with high radical formation and a flame mode in which the concentration of the OH radicals was reduced below the detection limit of the optical system. The ignition performances of two fuel injectors were compared to estimate the influence of radicals and water molecules from the preheater on the different types of flame stabilization. The shock wave system, the hydrogen air mixing, and the flame stabilization were studied with optical methods and computational fluid dynamics. It was observed that the two injectors react differently with increasing radical content in the incoming air. The injector with high total pressure loss is insensitive to the burnout in the preheater, whereas the injector that achieves low losses is considerably influenced by the quality of the air preheating. Thus, the cases of higher technical interest with a low pressure loss are more difficult to investigate using test rigs with vitiated air. A technical solution for improving the vitiator burnout, which allows the use of vitiators even in these critical cases, is presented."

Ethylene is injected 35 mm upstream of cavity flameholder from four orifices with 2-mm-diameter. The 1064 nm laser beam, from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser source running at 10 Hz and 940 mJ per pulse, is focused into cavity for ignition. High speed photography is used to capture the transient ignition process. The laser-induced gas breakdown, flame kernel generation and propagation are all recorded and ensuing stable supersonic combustion is established in cavity. The highly ionized plasma zone is almost round at starting, and then the surface of the flame kernel is wrinkled severely in 150 μs after the laser pulse due to the strong turbulence flow in cavity. The flame kernel is found rotating anti-clockwise and gradually moves upstream as the entrainment of circulation flow in cavity. The flame is stabilized at the corner of the cavity for about 200 μs, and then spreads from leading edge to trailing edge via the under part of shear layer to fully fill the entire cavity. The corner recirculation zone of cavity is of great importance for flame spreading. Eventually, a cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion is established in the supersonic flow roughly 2.9 ms after the laser pulse. Both the temporal evolution of normalized chemiluminescence intensity and normalized flame area show that the entire ignition process can be divided into four stages, which are referred as turbulent dissipation stage, combustion enhancement stage, reverting stage and combustion stabilization stage. The results show promising potentials of laser induced plasma for ignition in real scramjets."

The model combustor has a length of 600 mm and cross section of 72 mm width and 60 mm height. The fuel is directly injected into supersonic airflow (Mach number M=2, static pressure P(st)=160-250 Torr) through wall orifices. Two series of tests are focused on flameholding and mixing correspondingly. In the first series, the near-surface quasi-DC electrical discharge is generated by flush-mounted electrodes at electrical power deposition of W(pl)=3-24 kW. The scope includes parametric study of ignition and flame front dynamics, and comparison of three schemes of plasma generation: the first and the second layouts examine the location of plasma generators upstream and downstream from the fuel injectors. The third pattern follows a novel approach of combined mixing/ignition technique, where the electrical discharge distributes along the fuel jet. The last pattern demonstrates a significant advantage in terms of flameholding limit. In the second series of tests, a long discharge of submicrosecond duration is generated across the flow and along the fuel jet. A gasdynamic instability of thermal cavity developed after a deposition of high-power density in a thin plasma filament promotes the air-fuel mixing. The technique studied in this work has weighty potential for high-speed combustion applications, including cold start/restart of scramjet engines and support of transition regime in dual-mode scramjet and at off-design operation."

Any engineering error that is possible in the design and manufacturing procedure of the experimental model, and the intense heat release in the scramjet combustor, may cause the performance of the isolator to decrease, leading to its lack of capability in supporting the back pressure. The coupled implicit Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations and the two-equation standard k−ε turbulent model have been employed to numerically simulate the flow fields in a three-dimensional scramjet isolator. The effects of the divergent angle and the back pressure on the shock wave transition and the location of the leading edge of the shock wave train have been estimated and discussed. The obtained results show that the present numerical results are in very good agreement with the available experimental shadow-pictures, and the numerical method is more suitable for capturing the shock wave train and predicting the location of the leading edge of the shock wave train in the scramjet isolator than the present two-dimensional numerical methods. This is due to the small width-to-height ratio of the isolator and the intense three-dimensional flow structures. On increasing the divergent angle of the scramjet isolator, the static pressure along the central symmetrical line of the isolator decreases sharply. This is due to the strong expansion wave generated at the entrance of the isolator, and when the divergent angle of the isolator is sufficiently large, namely 1.5°, a zone of negative pressure is formed just ahead of the leading edge of the shock wave train. At the same time, the shock wave train varies from being oblique to being normal, and then back to oblique. With an increase in the prescribed back pressure at the exit of the scramjet isolator, the leading edge of the shock wave train moves forward towards the entrance of the isolator, and when the back pressure is sufficiently large, unstart conditions in the hypersonic inlet can take place if the shock train reaches the inlet."

Combustion in high-speed flows causes various problems such as flame instability and poor fuel–air mixing efficiency. One of the methods used to overcome these problems is to recess a cavity in the combustor wall where a secondary flow is generated. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is developed to analyse the reacting flow passing through the cavity-based scramjet combustor. The developed code is based on three-dimensional coupled Navier–Stokes and finite rate chemistry equations. An ethylene-air reduced chemical reaction model is used as a fuel–air combination. The Spalart–Allmaras model is utilised for turbulence closure. The non-dimensional form of the flow and chemical reaction equations are discretised using a finite volume method. The Jacobian-Free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) method is used to solve the coupled system of non-linear equations. The JFNK is a matrix-free solution method which improves the computational cost of Newton’s method. The parameters that affect the performance of the JFNK method are studied in the analysis of a scramjet combustor. The influence of the forcing term on the convergence of the JFNK method is studied in the analysis of scramjet combustor. Different upwind flux vector splitting methods are utilised. Various flux limiter techniques are employed for the calculations of higher order flux vectors. The effects of flux vector splitting and flux limiter methods on the convergence and accuracy of the JFNK method are evaluated. Moreover, the variations of the mixing efficiency with fuel injection angles are studied."
42,5,0,https://openalex.org/W4380841258,Scramjet Engine Design Challenges (52 vertices),"Strut fuel injection approach significantly influences the combustion mechanism inside the scramjet engines. To address this issue, researchers are nowadays mainly focused on a scramjet model with two struts. As the performance of the two-strut model is improved as compared to the original single-strut model as per the latest research findings, therefore the current research is focused on the impact of the different shapes of the two-strut on the combustion flow-field study of scramjet engines. Initially, experimental data from the already-published literature for a single strut is used to validate the implemented simulation techniques. Then, to investigate the combustion performance, different shapes of the two-strut are included in the already-existing DLR scramjet combustor. The SST k-ω turbulence model and steady RANS equations are used to carry out the numerical simulation. The semi-circular trailing edge half-wedge strut, with a combustion efficiency of roughly 92%, is the most effective strut configuration obtained in the current study. The findings also revealed that the semi-circular trailing edge half-wedge strut profile attains a stronger as well as a wider wake region, ensuring better combustion performance, and indicating that the two-strut model can be used as an efficient flame holder in subsequent works. Next, an analysis of how various inward fuel injection angles affect the performance of the optimum strut shape in terms of mixing efficiency and total pressure loss is provided. According to the study, an increase in the inward fuel injection angle significantly improves the mixing performance of the two-strut scramjet combustor. Additionally, the mixing and total pressure loss profiles reveal that the geometry with a 60° strut injection angle achieves early complete mixing within 0.145 m at the cost of only a slight increase in total pressure loss, and this outcome may lead to the development of a short-length supersonic combustor to minimize the drag forces and heat generation. Last but not the least, the optimal inward fuel injection angle (60°) of the two-strut and its effects on mixing performance under different freestream conditions are investigated, illustrating that mixing efficiency decreases with increasing Mach number in the same manner as single strut geometry."

The results were obtained with the inflow conditions of Mach number of 2.0, static temperature of 656.5 K and static pressure of 0.125 MPa, respectively. The equivalence ratio (ER) of hydrogen which was used as fuel changed from 0.04 to 0.30. Wall pressure measurement, schlieren, differential interferometry, high-speed framing of flame luminosity and OH-PLIF (planar laser-induced fluorescence) were introduced to characterize the combustion flow. Two typical combustion modes (scramjet mode and ramjet mode) could be attained by changing the ER of hydrogen. The combustion mode was scramjet mode when the ER of hydrogen was less than 0.23, while it was ramjet mode when the ER of hydrogen was greater than 0.23. When the combustion mode was scramjet mode, the flame stabilization mode was cavity shear layer stabilized combustion, and when the combustion mode was ramjet mode, the flame stabilization mode was combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion.

In this study, the asymmetric separation and combustion in both rectangular and circular scramjets are investigated numerically, and the effect of injection scheme is analyzed. The characteristics of the flow field are analyzed based on sufficient code verification. In the rectangular scramjet, the separation tends to occur in the corner due to the corner boundary-layer effect. The separation is asymmetric and only two corners have serious separation. The fuel penetration depth in the separation zone increases and the combustion is intensified. When the injection scheme is uniform, both the combustion and separation become weak. In the circular scramjet, the separation and combustion are basically axisymmetric in the scramjet with one-row injection scheme. The asymmetric combustion becomes obvious in cases with multi-row injection scheme. When the injection orifices distribute intensively on the top and bottom sides, the strongest and weakest separations occur near these two sides respectively. When the distribution of orifices becomes uniform, the direction of separation cannot be predicted.

The research status of regenerative cooling including supercritical heat transfer and hydrocarbon fuel coking is summarized. Furthermore, the optimized schemes of regenerative cooling channels based on unconventional structures and advanced manufacturing technologies are discussed in detail. At present, the cooling capacity of regenerative cooling is still insufficient for scramjets on account of the complicated working environment in the combustion chamber and the limited mass flow rate of coolant. The supercritical heat transfer in cooling channels is strongly influenced by the thermophysical properties of the coolant, probably resulting in heat transfer deterioration. In this case, further investigations are needed to reveal the mechanisms of heat transfer deterioration. Besides, coking of hydrocarbon fuel will resist the heat exchange between the coolant and cooling channels. To suppress the carbon deposition, deoxidizing fuel, fuel additives, surface treatment, and coating can be employed. The additive manufacturing lattice structure and the nanoparticles on the heat transfer surface extend the heat exchange area and increase the turbulence intensity in the cooling channel, which could be applied in the reused scramjets in the future."

It is shown that for such an approach there exist optimal values of reduced electric field E/N and transversal dimension d of the injected oxygen stream, which provide the minimal length of induction zone in the mixing layer. The optimal values of E/N and d depend on air flow parameters and the specific energy put into the oxygen. The injection of a thin oxygen stream (d = 1 mm) subjected to an electric discharge with E/N = 50–100 Td, which produces mostly singlet oxygen O2(a 1Δg) and molecules and atomic oxygen, allows one to arrange stable combustion in a scramjet duct at an extremely low air temperature Tair = 900 K and pressure Pair = 0.3 bar even at a small specific energy put into the oxygen Es = 0.2 J ncm−3, and to provide rather high combustion completeness η = 0.73. The advance in the energy released during combustion is much higher (hundred times), in this case, than the energy supplied to the oxygen stream in the electric discharge. This approach also makes it possible to ensure the rather high combustion completeness in the scramjet combustor with reduced length. The main reason for the combustion enhancement of the H2–air mixture in the scramjet duct is the intensification of chain-branching reactions due to the injection of a small amount of cold non-equilibrium oxygen plasma comprising highly reactive species, O2(a 1Δg) and molecules and O atoms, into the H2–air supersonic flow."

The results comply with the range, indicating the adopted simulation method can be extended for other investigations as well. The supersonic flow characteristics are determined based on the flow properties, combustion efficiency and total pressure loss. Findings The results revealed that the augmentation of hydrogen jet pressure via variation in flame features increases the static pressure in the vicinity of the strut and destabilize the normal shock wave position. Indeed, the pressure of the mainstream flow drives the shock wave toward the upstream direction. The study perceived that once the hydrogen jet pressure is reached 4 bar, the incoming flow attains a subsonic state due to the movement of normal shock wave ahead of the strut. It is noticed that the increase in hydrogen jet pressure in the supersonic flow field improves the jet penetration rate in the lateral direction of the flow and also increases the total pressure loss as compared with the baseline injection pressure condition. Practical implications The outcome of this research provides the influence of fuel injection pressure variations in the supersonic combustion phenomenon of hypersonic vehicles. Originality/value This paper substantiates the effect of increasing hydrogen jet pressure in the reacting supersonic airstream on the performance of a scramjet combustor."

In this invited paper, a temperature measurement method based on the TDLAS technique with a single diode laser was demonstrated. A continuous-wave (CW), distributed feedback (DFB) diode laser with an emission wavelength near 1.4 μm was used for temperature measurement, which could cover two water vapor (H2O) absorption lines located at 7153.749 cm−1 and 7154.354 cm−1 simultaneously. The output wavelength of the diode laser was calibrated according to the two absorption peaks in the time domain. Using this strategy, the TDLAS system has the advantageous of immunization to laser wavelength shift, simple system structure, reduced cost, and increased system robustness. The line intensity of the two target absorption lines under room temperature was about one-thousandth of that under high temperature, which avoided the measuring error caused by H2O in the environment. The system was tested on a McKenna flat flame burner and a scramjet model engine, respectively. It was found that, compared to the results measured by CARS technique and theoretical calculation, this TDLAS system had less than 4% temperature error when the McKenna flat flame burner was used.

82,1,0,https://openalex.org/W3196729144,Scramjet Engine Design Challenges (52 vertices),"The major hurdle in augmenting the performance of supersonic engines is the appropriate distribution of injected fuel within the supersonic chamber. That's why SSTk−ω model is used to explore the mixing characteristics of a transverse jet injection into a supersonic airstream. In this aspect, initially, the performance of the supersonic combustor is analysed using hydrogen and ethylene fuel in terms of mixing efficiency. Our results suggest that the flame holding capacity of hydrogen-fuelled combustor is better as than an ethylene-fuelled combustor. Additionally, to strengthen the mixing of fuel with supersonic air-flow, a novel shock generator is introduced and placed at different locations of the combustor. The flow-structure is studied comprehensively using two single shock generator and two dual shock generator to conclude the best possible geometry for improved performance. The results reveal that the fuel penetration depth of geometry 3 with dual shock generator has increased considerably. Moreover, geometry 3 offers enhanced mixing between the supersonic air and fuel compared to remaining models with the formation of a strong vortex pair and recirculation zone near the injection slot."
83,75,0,https://openalex.org/W2408184302,Scramjet Engine Design Challenges (52 vertices),"Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was employed to investigate the fuel/oxidizer mixing process in an ethylene fueled scramjet combustor with a rearwall-expansion cavity. The numerical solver was first validated for an experimental flow, the DLR strut-based scramjet combustor case. Shock wave structures and wall-pressure distribution from the numerical simulations were compared with experimental data and the numerical results were shown in good agreement with the available experimental data. Effects of the injection location on the flow and mixing process were then studied. It was found that with a long injection distance upstream the cavity, the fuel is transported much further into the main flow and a smaller subsonic zone is formed inside the cavity. Conversely, with a short injection distance, the fuel is entrained more into the cavity and a larger subsonic zone is formed inside the cavity, which is favorable for ignition in the cavity. For the rearwall-expansion cavity, it is suggested that the optimized ignition location with a long upstream injection distance should be in the bottom wall in the middle part of the cavity, while the optimized ignition location with a short upstream injection distance should be in the bottom wall in the front side of the cavity. By employing a cavity direct injection on the rear wall, the fuel mass fraction inside the cavity and the local turbulent intensity will both be increased due to this fueling, and it will also enhance the mixing process which will also lead to increased mixing efficiency. For the rearwall-expansion cavity, the combined injection scheme is expected to be an optimized injection scheme."
84,95,10,https://openalex.org/W2772830642,Scramjet Engine Performance Optimization (7 vertices),"The scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) is an air-breathing engine with the supersonic flow at the combustor entrance, i.e., with essentially lower deceleration of flow in the inlet with respect to common ramjet. The scramjet is designed for hypersonic flight of vehicle with Mach number large than 5 or 6, where the efficiency of a subsonic ramjet decreases, because the deceleration of high-speed flow to small subsonic speeds leads to extremely high temperature at the entrance to combustor, that, in its turn, generates a series of effects, deteriorating the performance of classical ramjet. The scramjet is characterized by strong coupling of all its elements. Supersonic core from the inlet to the nozzle, essential subsonic zones in thick boundary layers and high losses caused by strong shock waves, by viscous effects, by dissociation and radiation result in a situation, when positive thrust may be reached only on the basis of joint optimization of the whole flowpath. In comparison with experimental investigations, which remain very challenging to conduct in such flow conditions, computational fluid dynamics is an attractive complementary tool for the study supersonic reactive flow in the scramjet flowpath. Understanding and prediction of the flow structure are necessary for achieving the stable and efficient combustion, high thrust, and thermostable construction of the scramjet. The first half of the chapter addresses fundamentals of turbulent supersonic combustion: physics of combustion in supersonic flows with regard to scramjets, Navier--Stokes equations for multispecies reacting gas flow, kinetic schemes for simulation of scramjets, RANS/URANS, and LES approaches, the closure problems for turbulent fluxes. Particular attention is paid to the discussion of the difficulties when resolving closure problems for reaction rates. The contemporary models to account for turbulence-chemistry interactions (TCI) are shortly presented. The second half of the chapter focuses on partially stirred reactor (PaSR) turbulent combustion models. Transported PaSR (TPaSR) and unsteady PaSR models are described in details, and experience of their application to simulation of experiments on supersonic combustion (within the framework of LES approach) is demonstrated. Finally, the problem of the selection of “correct” solution among multiple solutions of PaSR steady-state equations is considered."

A scramjet intake model developed by Saied Emami et al. (1995)[1] is adopted as baseline model in this study. Ansys Fluent 18 is used to perform numerical simulations to study the flow through baseline model and modified models. A comparison is made between the available pressure data in the existing literature and in the present numerical study to validate the computational methodology followed. This study involves with scramjet intake models having ramp leading edge blunt radii of 0.0025 in., 0.005 in., 0.0075 in., and 0.01 in. The changes in the velocity boundary layer and thermal boundary are studied. A little reduction in the flow separation is observed from the wall shear stress plot. The shock pattern in the isolator section improves and is seen clearly from numerical schlieren. Considerable improvement in the total pressure recovery is achieved. The Mach number at the isolator exit has also increased due to the ramp leading edge blunt"

To foster performance evaluation tools for future hypersonic vehicles, developing accurate yet computationally efficient solution methods is of great importance. In this work, a new subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations is derived and used in a three-dimensional in-house flow solver to provide simulations of experimental scramjet ground tests. In particular, this paper introduces a hybrid model closure with the reaction-rate approach to close the filtered chemical source terms in the governing equations for species mass fractions and total energy. The model developed here makes use of a linear bridging function, depending on the segregation rate of the mixture fraction, between a resolved contribution issued from a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) estimation, and a subgrid-scale (SGS) contribution where a closure that approximates the Lagrangian trajectory in the composition space is retained. The new model considers the effect of fluctuations of compositions and can be extended to take into account, for example, the fluctuations of temperature. The new approach is tested using a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor from circular injector into a Mach 2 vitiated airflow for total pressure and temperature of 0.40 MPa and 1695 K, respectively. The selected operating conditions are representative of the LAPCAT-II dual-mode ramjet/scramjet combustion. Chemistry is described using a four-step reduced mechanism. The results obtained with the present modelling proposal are compared to those issued from numerical simulations performed with the quasi-laminar chemistry or PSR approach. These results do show that, even for a highly resolved computational mesh, the effects of composition fluctuations remain significant, especially in the vicinity of the injection where the SGS fluctuations of the scalar field are non-negligible."

In this work, the presence of the strut fin inner the nozzle injector on the distribution and penetration mechanism of fuel jet at supersonic cross air stream is broadly investigated. The main novelty of this work is to disclose the fuel mixing mechanism inside combustion chamber with strut. Computational fluid dynamic is applied for the simulation of different nozzle types with an inner fin at high-compressible airflow. The type of injectors (3-lobe, circular and 4-lobe injector) and height of strut fin (h = 2 mm and 4 mm) are also investigated in the present research to unveil the impacts of the proposed configuration on the mixing mechanism of fuel jet. Obtained findings show that the use of the inner fin improves the mixing fuel when the strength of the produced vortex is not so high. Comparison of fuel mixing indicates that the 3-lobe injector has higher efficiency (35%) than 4-lobe and circular nozzles."

In such devices a microwave energy propagates along the jet as a surface wave, which is accompanied by radiative losses. The similar phenomenon is used in a so-called “plasma antenna” devices based on discharge tubes. Besides that, plasma jets are studied for Plasma-Assisted Combustion in scramjet engines. For the same purpose a sub-critical and other RF discharges were suggested. The excited species and radicals influence the results for both types of techniques. However, the joint action of both RF energy supply and plasma jets on combustion in scramjets was not evaluated yet. A phenomenon of RF discharge propagation far from the feeding point along the combustion zone was already described, while the spatial distribution of electromagnetic energy and its influence on combustion efficiency are still unclear. Development of RF plasma torch for the Plasma-Assisted Combustion is reasonable in the case of high coupling efficiency, which depends on resonance phenomena and, thus, on geometrical parameters of the non-mixed part of the plasma jet in the flow. The signal reflection may damage RF power source, while the radiation losses may be of uncertain effect. This problem was studied experimentally using the physical model. The energy coupling and impedance mismatch were evaluated for various plasma column dimensions. The results are discussed."
