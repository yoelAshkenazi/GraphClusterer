  Association and &lt;Pioneer Savings> of Racine, Wis., said they
  have signed a definitive agreement to combine the two
  associations into a publicly held holding company to be called
  Republic Capital Group Inc.
      The associations said they would form the company by
  exchanging Republic's stock for shares in the holding company,
  which Pioneer savers could purchase when Pioneer converts from
  mutual to stock ownership.
      The associations added that they would remain independent,
  but wholly owned, units of the holding company.
      The associations said they would continue to do business
  using their present names and management.
      The combination of Republic's 459 mln dlrs in assets with
  Pioneer's 125 mln dlrs would make the new holding company the
  fifth largest savings and loan organization in Wisconsin, they
  said.
      The associations said the move is subject to approval by

  Economics Minister Martin Bangemann said
  the state could not continue to pour money into West Germany's

  endangered other parts of the economy.
      ""The situation is completely absurd from an economic point
  of view,"" Bangemann told the newspaper Die Welt in an interview
  released ahead of publication tomorrow.
      ""We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steel
  to an enormous extent and at the same time putting a huge
  burden on all other branches of industry and making them
  uncompetitive,"" he said.
      Bangemann said the steel and coal industries were no longer
  capable of being competitive. Continued state subsidies would
  not save them but would only prolong their lives artifically
  for a few years, he said.
      ""That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them in

      Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already
  been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this
  sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association
  reported to the U.S. official.
      In a report dated March 10, the official said that about
  800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance
  of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.
      An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from
  July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav
  corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.
      Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav
  corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for
  exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.
      Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged
  around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier

Dome, which is restructuring over $6 billion in debt, considers Encor a strategic investment and is reluctant to sell. However, the bank's desire to reduce Dome's debt and the potential for other creditors to object to the sale may influence Dome's decision. Additionally, Encor's joint liability in loans to Dome for Beaufort Sea exploration and Dome Mines' guarantee of Dome Petroleum's debt could further complicate any potential sale."

The company aims to shift towards higher value-added businesses and broaden its base, according to chairman-elect Denys Henderson. ICI has announced the formation of a new US drug company, ICI Pharma, which will double its current pharmaceutical sales to $1.1 billion by 1990. Henderson believes that ICI's pharmaceutical business is overshadowed by Glaxo's, despite being the second largest drug maker in the UK. In 1986, US drug sales accounted for 40% of ICI's worldwide drug sales of $1.5 billion, which brought in 27% of its total profits. By 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division is expected to account for about 30% of total company profits. The new US drug company will act as a second sales force to increase exposure to doctors, with 145 new salespeople to be hired by October. ICI's major new products in development are Statil, Zoladex, and Carwin, each expected to bring in over $200 million in annual sales. Henderson expects the company's 1987 results to surpass 1986's income of $888 million on sales of $15 billion, boosted by the acquisition of Glidden Paints. ICI has $9 billion available for acquisitions, with more acquisitions planned for 1987, but Henderson rules out a pharmaceutical acquisition as too expensive. Henderson's biggest challenge as chairman is to maintain the company's earnings momentum after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses."

  Weyerhaeuser Co said it should
  have significant increases in earnings in 1987 and 1988 should
  be another very good year.
      Weyerhaeuser reported 1986 earnings of 276.7 mln dlrs, or
  1.91 dlrs per share, on 5.65 billion dlrs in revenues.
      Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company to
  invest and acquire much more aggressively than it has in the
  past few years, Weyerhaeuser also said.
      Weyerhaeuser, principally a lumber products company, said
  the forecast was made by the company's chief financial officer
  during a meeting of institutional investors in Tokyo.
      It also said its expects to see opportunities in the
  building products area, particularly in composite panels and in
  other engineered products directed toward specific, rather than
  commodity, end-use markets.
      But it said growth may be higher in added-value products,
  in financial services and in other diversified businesses.
      In addition, the company said rising product prices and
  demand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major world
  markets, except in the case of some light-weighted paper grades
  where overcapacity remains a problem.
      Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered its
  manufacturing cost structure and is obtaining significant
  productivity increases.

The 35 dollars per share price is considered fully valued, and the fact that Purolator has been on the market for some time without attracting other offers further supports this view. The stock price slightly declined today, indicating a lack of confidence in a higher bid. The deal includes a breakup fee that Purolator would have to pay if they back out, which could also deter potential rival bidders."

  Grain handling at Rotterdam port's
  main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the
  largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for
  the third day running.
      Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator
  Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the
  port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action
  because of a strike by technical staff.
      The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations
  over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain
  handlers stopped work.
      Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's
  scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam
  would face delays, but this was not happening yet.
      Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct
  operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.
      Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today
  produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union
  was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working
  week, at the bottom of the agenda.
      Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range
  of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer.

  European Community (EC) industry
  ministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures,
  drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer, and calculated to
  lead to the loss of about 22,000 jobs.
      The ministers resolved that the proposed closures, which
  should bring production capacity more in line with weak demand,
  ""remain considerably below the surplus in capacity.""
      They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with
  Eurofer, major steel companies and with governments, to
  pinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the
  annual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer.
      The Commission will draw up a new system  of steel
  production quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the full
  rigors of open competition.
      Commission sources said any new system would cover only
  heavy products representing about 45 pct of the market, instead
  of 65 pct under the present system.
      Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meet
  again in Brussels on June 1, the sources said.
      Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers
  capacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that
  this excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990.

  A number of individual zinc producing
  companies have approached the European Commission to sound out
  its reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntary
  reduction of smelting capacity, Commission sources said.
      The companies have been told that the Commission could not
  judge whether a plan would be acceptable under European
  Community, EC, competition rules until it had full details,
  they said.
      In 1983, the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss of
  about 130,000 tonnes of annual capacity, or about 10 pct of the
  total.
      However, the industry did not proceed with this plan as
  zinc market conditions improved in 1984, the sources noted.
      They said the companies which approached the Commission
  recently -- and which they did not name -- appeared to envisage
  a loss of productive capacity similar to that proposed in 1983.

The Eurofer plan, proposing closures that would affect 15.26 million tonnes of annual capacity and 22,000 jobs, was deemed insufficient by most ministers. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes suggested that 30 million tonnes of annual capacity should be closed by the end of 1990, particularly in the production of hot-rolled wide-strip products. Ministers agreed to expand and refine the Eurofer plan through discussions involving industry representatives, the Commission, and member states. However, disagreements emerged regarding the reduction of the quota production system and the distribution of closures and funding among member states, with Germany and the UK expressing contrasting positions."

  A White House-ordered report said 
  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
  could have potentially damaging implications for national
  security.
      The Energy Department study discusses several options to
  curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
      President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
  out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
  the depressed domestic oil industry.
      Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
  ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
  years, this report shows that there is justification for
  national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
  domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""
      The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
  consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
      Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
  oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
      President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
  determination that the country never again become captive to a
  foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
  sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
      The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
  make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
  oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
  depress the nation's economy.

521,0,0,907,Economic Indicators Show Mixed Results (44 vertices),"Japan is planning to reduce beef intervention prices for the upcoming fiscal year, but this move is unlikely to boost demand due to strict supply controls and a complex distribution system. The price reduction aims to protect farmers and narrow the price gap with European Community prices, but it may not significantly impact consumers or US meat exporters. Retail beef prices in Japan are high due to distribution issues, high production costs, and the operations of the Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC). American meat packers view Japan as a potential market, but the distribution system and supply control by the LIPC could limit demand even if retail prices drop. The US Agriculture Secretary will request the removal of beef import restrictions during an upcoming visit to Japan, where the beef import quota has been gradually increasing."

The study, which covers the years 1979-1981, has so far been deemed inaccurate by the officials, who plan to comment on the final results. A Reuter report claims the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies globally, favoring dairy farmers the most. Despite objections from some countries, Japan has agreed to the study's release, which is expected to be approved by OECD directors in mid-May. Japanese subsidies have decreased significantly since the study period due to budgetary constraints and currency fluctuations. The ministry source criticized the study for not considering differences in farming conditions across countries and predicted that Japan will be shown to have the highest farm subsidies. This could lead to increased pressure to open Japan's farm market, but the source did not elaborate on the potential impact on Japan's agriculture policy. The study aims to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations, but Japan is primarily an importer."

The government has achieved a reduction in state debt and budget deficit, but the French franc was recently devalued against the West German mark.

This comes after producer and consumer nations failed to agree on new export quotas to address the oversupply in the coffee market. The price of robusta coffee beans for May delivery has fallen to its lowest since 1982, with Ivory Coast estimating significant revenue losses if the market slide continues.

The decline was mainly attributed to a 33.90 billion franc deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, resulting from short-term financing instruments used by France. The Bank of France, along with other central banks, intervened in foreign exchange markets to support the franc and stabilize the mark, which led to a decrease in foreign currency reserves. This intervention culminated in the revaluation of the mark against the French franc on January 11th, easing pressure on the French currency.

While governments in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand welcome the pact as a way to stabilize prices and support the rubber industry, growers and traders are concerned that the buffer stock mechanism will interfere with free market forces and prevent rubber prices from rising sharply. The new INRA, which replaces the current agreement expiring on October 22, aims to maintain price stability through its buffer stock system. Malaysian officials are optimistic about the new agreement and believe it will prevent a potential depression in prices, while Indonesian and Thai officials also see benefits in price stabilization and improved financial provisions. However, Malaysian growers and traders prefer a free market without the influence of a large INRA buffer stock, which they believe limits price increases. Traders in the region also worry that the new pact might pressure prices in the long term as increased production could result from the pact's price stabilization potential. Overall, the new INRA has generated differing opinions among Asian stakeholders, with some favoring its price stabilization measures and others expressing concerns about its impact on the free market and potential limitations on price increases."

The bureau is responsible for channeling funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official purposes. The base lending rate for state bodies, such as the Japan Development Bank and the People's Finance Corp, typically follows long-term prime rates, but the last cut could not be implemented due to the legal minimum rate set by the Trust Fund Bureau. The ministry aims to abolish this minimum rate and introduce a market-related rate to stimulate the domestic economy. Long-term bankers have already been allowed to reduce their prime rate to 5.5%, and the ministry is in discussions with depositors using the bureau, postal savings system, and Japan welfare annuity to determine the appropriate market rates for setting the bureau's deposit rate.

This profit was made possible by the government's intervention in the currency market during a crisis in September and October 1986. Lawson resisted market pressure for a two-point interest rate rise, opting for a one-point increase instead, which was later reversed by subsequent rate cuts. The government's intervention involved selling around 1.0 billion dollars from reserves to support the pound, and the subsequent repurchase of these dollars resulted in a profit of tens of millions of pounds. This strategy not only helped stabilize the currency but also allowed for a more moderate interest rate adjustment."

662,50,0,287,Global Economy Experiences Fluctuations (12 vertices),"Japan's economy is expected to remain sluggish in the upcoming months after a poor performance in 1986, according to private economists. Consumer spending, a key driver of domestic demand, is likely to remain low despite strong housing and business investment. The Economic Planning Agency reported a 0.7% decline in private spending in the fourth quarter of 1986, the first decrease in 12 years, which shocked economists. Japan's gross national product rose 0.8% in the same quarter, but GNP growth for 1986 was down from the previous year. Economists attribute the decline in consumer spending to both warm winter weather and consumer pessimism about future income and pay rises. The outlook for pay increases is gloomy due to job losses in industries affected by the rising yen. Some economists believe that the 0.8% growth in the fourth quarter may have been inflated by special factors, including heavy public sector spending on gold coins for Emperor Hirohito's 60th anniversary. The economy is expected to contract in the current quarter due to a lack of significant government spending and weak consumer spending."

The controls are seen as a response to US pressure for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with the US.

According to the analyst Anthony Bird Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review, the planned expansion of aluminum capacity after 1990 will be inadequate to meet the anticipated increase in demand. The article highlights the need for additional capacity, with a projected requirement of 18 million tonnes by 1995, while only 15 million tonnes are currently scheduled. Bird predicts higher economic growth and increased imports, leading to a sharp rise in non-socialist world consumption. The review suggests that aluminum companies may need to adapt their strategies to accommodate the changing market dynamics, and higher aluminum prices may be necessary to encourage the construction of new smelters. Production costs are expected to rise due to the diminishing alumina capacity and potential electricity supply issues. The article also mentions the short-term dull outlook for the world economy and provides forecasts for aluminum consumption and production in 1987."

814,95,0,955,ICO Coffee Quota Dispute (10 vertices),"Coffee traders are anticipating a significant selloff in London coffee futures, potentially dropping prices to $1.00 or $0.80 per pound, due to the International Coffee Organization's (ICO) inability to reach an agreement on coffee export quotas. The breakdown in talks was attributed to Brazil's resistance to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria, while the U.S. insisted on quotas reflecting countries' supply capabilities. This failure to agree on quotas is expected to result in heavy producer selling, a price war among coffee roasting companies, and a subsequent drop in supermarket prices. The absence of quotas will likely impact developing coffee-producing countries, especially in Africa and Colombia, leading to potential losses of up to $3 billion annually."

  Sweden's rate of inflation during
  January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in
  calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
      The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of
  the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without
  explaining how the error arose.
      Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1
  pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation
  rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for
  January's revised figures, it added.
      Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against
  a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct
  in February 1986, the bureau said.
      The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government
  imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the
  bureau added.

      ""We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been
  abolished at all,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
      He said the system would be reintroduced after current
  talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
  and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.
      Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction
  system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private
  bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.
      Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the
  government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.
      It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and
  strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible
  for the government and the private sector, he said.
      Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The
  kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.
  In January 1987 the government was more than two months in
  arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and
  the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange
  rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

832,95,0,66,International Cocoa Agreement Updates (8 vertices),"The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is preparing to implement a buffer stock system to stabilize cocoa prices, but traders and analysts are skeptical about its effectiveness. The buffer stock may face challenges due to the surplus of cocoa in the market, with initial purchases potentially reaching 75,000 tonnes without significantly impacting prices. The ICCO's indicator price is currently below the ""must buy"" level, and the buffer stock manager might delay purchases until forward prices lift the indicator. The system's rules, including price differentials and purchase limits, could restrict the buffer stock's ability to remove cocoa from the market effectively. Traders believe that the buffer stock may not help the terminal market but could provide support for quality cocoas. However, with the market already in surplus and the buffer stock carrying over 100,000 tonnes from the previous agreement, doubts remain about its ability to counter bearish pressure."

  The International Cocoa Organization,
  ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft
  proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.
      The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
  Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European
  Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock
  should operate, they said.
      The proposal involved three key principles. First, the
  buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather
  than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.
      Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be
  free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.
      The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could
  comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third
  laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager
  would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be
  set by a formula, the delegates said.
      After the plan was presented, working group delegates met
  briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all
  consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction
  to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group
  meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.
      Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to
  work from, one consumer delegate said.
      Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for
  negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.

This growth is expected to be primarily driven by transport fuels, but higher consumer prices may impact the rate of growth. The IEA also predicts that if crude and product prices remain stable, end-users may reduce their oil stocks, leading to a potential shift in market share from heavy fuel to natural gas. OECD oil stocks were estimated at 428 million tonnes in April 1987, remaining flat compared to the beginning of the year due to a projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter. Company and government oil stocks have increased, with company stocks rising in line with consumption after a five-year decline. World oil supply decreased in the first quarter of 1987, mainly due to a drop in OPEC crude production and seasonal factors in Centrally Planned Economies.

This increase was primarily driven by overseas oil production, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, and Malaysia, as well as oil sands in Canada. However, new discoveries and reserve acquisitions did not fully offset the production levels. The average price of oil and gas decreased by 41% year-over-year, leading to a 38% decline in earnings from exploration and production, which fell to $3.1 billion in 1986 from $4.9 billion in 1985. Exxon acquired 11.2 million acres for exploration across 10 countries, but capital expenditures for exploration and production were reduced to $4.6 billion from the previous year's $7.6 billion, with further cuts expected in 1987. The company's refinery operations saw significant improvements, with earnings rising to nearly $2 billion in 1986, thanks to a successful upgrading program at its Baytown, Texas refinery and a project in Rotterdam, both of which focused on processing lower-grade crudes to produce higher yields of light products."

      Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee

  little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only
  about 30 pct of its total annual exports.
      Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
  there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
  offer higher prices than non-members, he said.
      The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes
  of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.
      Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000
  tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the
  previous year.

  government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed
  ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.
      Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial

The US imposed the sanctions in 1982 in response to the suppression of the Solidarity free trade union, and Poland now says it has a moral right to assistance from the US. However, Western economists argue that the drying up of credits was due to economic reasons, not political ones, and that Poland's debt and lack of competitiveness will make it difficult to regain access to the US market. Polish officials are seeking a lead from the US in repairing the damage, but Western diplomats and economists remain skeptical, suggesting that Poland's economic problems are largely internal and that the impact of sanctions has been overstated."
