1,10,0,mathematics,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself.  There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics)."
2,0,0,Cauchy sequence,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In mathematics, a Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.  More precisely, given any small positive distance, all excluding a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other.  Cauchy sequences are named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy; they may occasionally be known as fundamental sequences. It is not sufficient for each term to become arbitrarily close to the preceding term."
3,0,0,invention,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition, idea or process.  An invention may be an improvement upon a machine, product, or process for increasing efficiency or lowering cost.  It may also be  an entirely new concept.  If an idea is unique enough either as a stand-alone invention or as a significant improvement over the work of others, it can be patented."
4,1,0,thermodynamic processes,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Classical thermodynamics considers three main kinds of thermodynamic processes: (1) changes in a system, (2) cycles in a system,  and (3) flow processes. (1) A Thermodynamic process is a process in which the thermodynamic state of a system is changed.  A change in a system is defined by a passage from an initial to a final state of thermodynamic equilibrium.  In classical thermodynamics, the actual course of the process is not the primary concern, and often is ignored."
5,0,0,essence,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Essence (Latin: essentia) has various meanings and uses for different thinkers and in different contexts.  It is used in philosophy and theology as a designation for the property or set of properties or attributes that make an entity the entity it is or, expressed negatively, without which it would lose its identity.  Essence is contrasted with accident, which is a property or attribute the entity has accidentally or contingently, but upon which its identity does not depend."
6,0,0,event (philosophy),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In philosophy, events are objects in time or instantiations of properties in objects.  On some views, only changes in the form of acquiring or losing a property can constitute events, like the lawn's becoming dry.  According to others, there are also events that involve nothing but the retaining of a property, e. g.  the lawn's staying wet.  Events are usually defined as particulars that, unlike universals, cannot repeat at different times."
7,0,0,future,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Culture ( KUL-chər) is a concept that encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, attitude, and habits of the individuals in these groups.  Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location. Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies."
8,0,0,priority date,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Priority date is a United States immigration concept – it is the date when a principal applicant first reveals his or her intent of immigration to the US government.  For family-sponsored applicants, the priority date is the date an immigration petition, filed on behalf of him or her, is received by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)."
9,0,0,novelty (patent),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Novelty is one of the patentability requirement for a patent claim, whose purpose is to prevent issuing patents on known things, i. e.  to prevent public knowledge from being taken away from the public domain. An invention is anticipated (i. e.  not new) and therefore not patentable if it was known to the public before the priority date of the patent application.  Although the concept of ""novelty"" in patent law appears simple and self-explanatory, this view is very far from reality."
10,10,0,order theory,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Order theory is a branch of mathematics that investigates the intuitive notion of order using binary relations.  It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as ""this is less than that"" or ""this precedes that"".  This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions.  A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the order theory glossary.  Background and motivation Orders are everywhere in mathematics and related fields like computer science."
11,10,0,Set (mathematics),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In mathematics, a set is a collection of different things; these things are called elements or members of the set and are typically mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets.   A set may have a finite number of elements or be an infinite set.  There is a unique set with no elements, called the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton."
12,2,0,Universals (metaphysics),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In metaphysics, a universal is what particular things have in common, namely characteristics or qualities.  In other words, universals are repeatable or recurrent entities that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things.  For example, suppose there are two chairs in a room, each of which is green.  These two chairs share the quality of ""chairness"", as well as ""greenness"" or the quality of being green; in other words, they share two ""universals""."
13,0,0,Power (physics),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Power is the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit time.  In the International System of Units, the unit of power is the watt, equal to one joule per second.  Power is a scalar quantity. Specifying power in particular systems may require attention to other quantities; for example, the power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the aerodynamic drag plus traction force on the wheels, and the velocity of the vehicle."
14,1,0,phase transition,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In physics, chemistry, and other related fields like biology, a phase transition (or phase change) is the physical process of transition between one state of a medium and another.  Commonly the term is used to refer to changes among the basic states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas, and in rare cases, plasma.  A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform physical properties."
15,0,0,Reversible process (thermodynamics),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In thermodynamics, a reversible process is a process, involving a system and its surroundings, whose direction can be reversed by infinitesimal changes in some properties of the surroundings, such as pressure or temperature. Throughout an entire reversible process, the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, both physical and chemical, and nearly in pressure and temperature equilibrium with its surroundings."
16,0,10,present,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Presence (Russian: Присутствие, romanized: Prisutstvie) is a 1992 Russian drama film directed by Andrey Dobrovolskiy.  Plot The film tells about a lonely man who has only memories of his beloved woman, which cannot be returned."
17,2,0,thermodynamics,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Thermodynamics deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation.  The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics.  Thermodynamics plays a role in a wide variety of topics in science and engineering."
18,1,0,Praeneste fibula,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"The Praeneste fibula (the ""brooch of Palestrina"") is a golden fibula or brooch, today housed in the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome.   The fibula bears an inscription in Old Latin, claiming craftsmanship by one Manios and ownership by one Numazios.   At the time of its discovery in the late nineteenth century, it was accepted as the earliest known specimen of the Latin language."
19,1,1,particulars,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In metaphysics, particulars or individuals are usually contrasted with universals.  Universals concern features that can be exemplified by various different particulars.  Particulars are often seen as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers.  There are, however, theories of abstract particulars or tropes.  For example, Socrates is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e. g."
20,0,0,patentability,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Within the context of a national or multilateral body of law, an invention is patentable if it meets the relevant legal conditions to be granted a patent.  By extension, patentability also refers to the substantive conditions that must be met for a patent to be held valid.  Requirements The patent laws usually require that, for an invention to be patentable, it must be:Patentable subject matter, i. e."
21,0,0,time,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"The is a grammatical article in English, denoting persons or things that are already or about to be mentioned, under discussion, implied or otherwise presumed familiar to listeners, readers, or speakers.  It is the definite article in English.  The is the most frequently used word in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words."
22,1,0,existence,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Existence is the state of having being or reality in contrast to nonexistence and nonbeing.  Existence is often contrasted with essence: the essence of an entity is its essential features or qualities, which can be understood even if one does not know whether the entity exists. Ontology is the philosophical discipline studying the nature and types of existence.  Singular existence is the existence of individual entities while general existence refers to the existence of concepts or universals."
23,1,0,Property (philosophy),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In logic and philosophy (especially metaphysics), a property is a characteristic of an object; a red object is said to have the property of redness.  The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties.  A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be instantiated, and often in more than one object."
24,10,0,mathematical object,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"A mathematical object is an abstract concept arising in mathematics.  Typically, a mathematical object can be a value that can be assigned to a symbol, and therefore can be involved in formulas.  Commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers, expressions, shapes, functions, and sets.  Mathematical objects can be very complex; for example, theorems, proofs, and even theories are considered as mathematical objects in proof theory."
25,0,0,clock,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"A lock is a mechanical or electronic fastening device that is released by a physical object (such as a key, keycard, fingerprint, RFID card, security token or coin), by supplying secret information (such as a number or letter permutation or password), by a combination thereof, or it may only be able to be opened from one side, such as a door chain. A key is a device that is used to operate a lock (to lock or unlock it)."
26,1,0,sequence,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters.  Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms).  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence.  Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter."
27,1,0,engine,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost.  The word engineer (Latin ingeniator, the origin of the Ir."
28,0,0,patent claim,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In a patent or patent application, the claims define in technical terms the extent, i. e.  the scope, of the protection conferred by a patent, or the protection sought in a patent application.  In other words, the purpose of the claims is to define which subject-matter is protected by the patent (or sought to be protected by the patent application).  This is termed as the ""notice function"" of a patent claim—to warn others of what they must not do if they are to avoid infringement liability."
29,0,0,Motion,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"A morion (Spanish: morrión) (Catalan: morrió) is a type of open-faced combat helmet originally from Spain, used from the beginning of the 16th century to the early-17th century.  The morion usually had a flat brim and a crest running from front to back.  Its introduction was contemporaneous with European exploration of much of North, Central and South America - explorers such as Hernando de Soto and Coronado may have supplied morions to their foot-soldiers in the 1540s."
30,0,0,public domain,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"The public domain (PD) consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply.  Those rights may have expired, been forfeited, expressly waived, or may be inapplicable.  Because no one holds the exclusive rights, anyone can legally use or reference those works without permission. As examples, the works of William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Miguel de Cervantes, Zoroaster, Lao Zi, Confucius, Aristotle,  L."
31,1,0,irreversible process,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In science, a process that is not reversible is called irreversible.  This concept arises frequently in thermodynamics.  All complex natural processes are irreversible, although a phase transition at the coexistence temperature (e. g.  melting of ice cubes in water) is well approximated as reversible."
32,1,0,Latins (Italic tribe),Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"The Latins (Latin: Latinus (m. ), Latina (f. ), Latini (m.  pl. )), sometimes known as the Latials or Latians, were an Italic tribe that included the early inhabitants of the city of Rome (see Roman people).  From about 1000 BC, the Latins inhabited the small region known to the Romans as Old Latium (in Latin Latium vetus), the area in the Italian Peninsula between the river Tiber and the promontory of Mount Circeo 100 km (62 mi) southeast of Rome."
33,0,0,Invention,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition, idea or process.  An invention may be an improvement upon a machine, product, or process for increasing efficiency or lowering cost.  It may also be  an entirely new concept.  If an idea is unique enough either as a stand-alone invention or as a significant improvement over the work of others, it can be patented."
34,10,0,Thermodynamic system,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"A thermodynamic system is a body of matter and/or radiation separate from its surroundings that can be studied using the laws of thermodynamics. Thermodynamic systems can be passive and active according to internal processes.  According to internal processes, passive systems and active systems are distinguished: passive, in which there is a redistribution of available energy, active, in which one type of energy is converted into another."
35,1,0,recollection,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Recall in memory refers to the mental process of retrieval of information from the past.  Along with encoding and storage, it is one of the three core processes of memory.  There are three main types of recall: free recall, cued recall and serial recall.  Psychologists test these forms of recall as a way to study the memory processes of humans and animals. Two main theories of the process of recall are the two-stage theory and the theory of encoding specificity."
36,10,0,philosophy,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Philosophy ('love of wisdom' in Ancient Greek) is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like existence, reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language.  It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its own methods and assumptions. Historically, many of the individual sciences, such as physics and psychology, formed part of philosophy.  However, they are considered separate academic disciplines in the modern sense of the term."
37,1,0,memory,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Memory is the faculty of the mind by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed.  It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.  If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop.  Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia."
38,1,0,nonbeing,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"In metaphysics and ontology, nonexistent objects are a concept advanced by Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong in the 19th and 20th centuries within a ""theory of objects"".  He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects.  Starting with the ""principle of intentionality"", mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object.  People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist."
39,0,0,Merriam-Webster,Exploring Various Academic Disciplines (80 vertices),"Merriam-Webster, Incorporated is an American company that publishes reference books and is mostly known for its dictionaries.  It is the oldest dictionary publisher in the United States. In 1831, George and Charles Merriam founded the company as G & C Merriam Co.  in Springfield, Massachusetts.
