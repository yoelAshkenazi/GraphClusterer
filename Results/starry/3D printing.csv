Most of the research works in the literature are focused on the system design and optimization of the printing process. However, only very few reports are available on the safety of 3D-printed foods. In this regard, the present chapter mainly discusses the safety aspects of 3D-printed foods, challenges, and research needs. Consumers have the right to know about the source and origin of food ingredients which cannot be overviewed when it comes to 3D-printed foods. Even though 3D printing delivers foods based on localized demand, it is crucial to provide proper labeling of 3D-printed foods. The storage stability of 3D-printed foods is equally important as that of the optimization of printability. The significance of postprocessing and end quality of 3D-printed foods are highlighted in this chapter. Thus, the sustenance of food printing relies on not only the technical development but also the practical implementation with societal and economic implications in the food supply and distribution chain. Various measures considered in preserving the storage stability, safety, and edibility of 3D-printed foods are discussed in context with food safety, labeling, legal framework, and regulation concerns. The present chapter envisages the practical challenges associated with the safety of 3D-printed foods and highlights a future outlook on measures to be undertaken in overcoming safety concerns to explore 3D food printing at the commercial level."

However, printability of the ingredients and the quality of the 3D printed food products are dependent on several product and printing parameters. In this study, nutrient dense cookies were developed with underutilized ingredients including jackfruit seed powder and finger millet powder as base materials using 3D food printing. The hardness, rheological behavior, and microstructure of 3D printed cookies with different products (e.g., water butter ratio) and printing (e.g., fill density and temperature) parameters were analyzed. The 3D printed cookies were developed by extruding at 27 and 30 °C with fill density values of 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% and water butter ratios of 3:10 and 6:5. The 3D-printed cookie dough exhibited a more elastic behavior with higher storage modulus values than the loss modulus. The hardness of the baked cookies was influenced by printing temperature, fill density, and water butter ratio of 3D printed cookie dough and their interactions. The closed porosity of 3D printed cookies increased while the open porosity decreased with an increase in fill density. The baking times required were longer for 3D-printed cookies with higher fill density values. Overall, this study shows the importance of considering the specific ingredient and printing parameters to develop high quality 3D-printed cookies."

Hitherto, most research related to 3D food printing focused on exploration of suitable recipes and optimal printing parameters for making custom-shaped 3D-printed foods, such as chocolates, cookies, cheese and vegetable pastes. Although the previous studies broadened the scope of 3D food printing applications, they did not provide rational guidelines to replace trial-and-error strategies during optimization of new 3D food printing applications by considering rheological properties of food materials suitable for printing. Moreover, most efforts focused on customization of the food design whereas 3D printing also had been suggested to allow preparation of foods with altered perceived taste and texture. The few studies that showed the impact of 3D printed food design on texture properties did primarily employ instrumental analysis while these should be complemented with sensory texture and mouthfeel perception. This study therefore aimed at understanding the relationships between material properties, printing conditions and physical properties of printed foods (Chapter 2 and 3), and how 3D food printing can be used to affect texture and taste perception of foods through modulating food structure (Chapter 4, 5 and 6)."

For this reason, the application of traditional textile materials in 3D printing has become a hot topic in the field of 3D printed clothing. Based on the above, this work prepared four kinds of cotton-containing composite solutions and then impregnated thermoplastic polyurethane core yarns in these solutions to obtain four types of 3D printed cotton-containing composite core yarns (3Dp-C-CYs). Afterward, based on the two-dimensional (2D) braiding method, four kinds of cotton-containing 3D printing wires used for fused deposition molding technology were prepared by wrapping low-melting polyester filaments around the different 3Dp-C-CYs. After comparing the printing performance of the four cotton-containing 3D printing wires, the wire containing cotton powders had the best comprehensive performance and was selected to print the cotton-containing 3D printed fabrics. The results showed that the cotton-containing 3D printed fabric has good flatness and contains a large number of cotton powders; in addition, compared with the traditional polylactic acid and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer 3D printed fabrics, the 3D printed fabric made up of cotton-containing 3D printing wire can provide a closer wearing experience to that of cotton fabric.

To evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional printing atrial septal defect (ASD) models from three dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE) images and to lay the foundation for the application of 3D printing technology in the diagnosis and treatment of ASD.


Methods
Twenty patients with ASD were analyzed retrospectively.2D-TEE and 3D-TEE were performed before ASD occlusion. The 3D-TEE data were post-processed by Mimics software and the volume images of ASD in STL format were developed. Then the STL file was output and the ASD 3D models were printed. The ASD size parameters included the maximal diameter (Dmax), the minimal diameter (Dmin), circumference(C) and area(A), which were measured from 2D-TEE images, 3D-TEE images and 3D printing models, respectively. The absolute difference value of ASD size parameters between 3D printing models and 2D-TEE images, or 3D-TEE images were calculated. The sizes of occluder were recorded during the operation and the preoperative exercises on 3D printing models were performed.


Results
There were no significant difference in ASD size parameters among 3D printing models, 2D-TEE and 3D-TEE images(all P>0.05), the ASD size parameters were concordant well between 3D printing models and 2D-TEE or 3D-TEE images. Moreover, the absolute difference value of ASD size parameters between 3D printing models and 2D-TEE or 3D-TEE images were little. In addition, linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation in the Dmax measured from 3D printing models and the sizes of occulder used in the operation (r=0.94, P<0.05). In the ASD 3D printing models the preoperative exercise had an impressive effect.


Conclusions
It is quite feasible to use 3D-TEE images as the data source of ASD 3D printing models.Ultrasound-derived ASD 3D printing models are of highly accuracy, which have the potential to provide evidence for the clinical application of 3D printing technology.

With the extrusion-based 3D printing technique, the main challenges for precision and accuracy in high concentration nanocellulose 3D printed structures are proper printing parameters and appropriate adhesion between printed layers. Therefore, this study aims to improve the adhesion between high content nanocellulose printed layers by blending different lignin concentrations and optimizing the twin-screw extruder printing parameters. The lignin concentrations are optimized in nanocellulose paste by assessing the mechanical properties, shape retention, and shrinkage of 3D printed structures. To ease shape retention, the 3D printed structures are dried at controlled humidity (45%) and temperature (25oC). The surface morphology of the 3D printed structures is observed by scanning electron microscope."

The surface wetting characteristics (e.g., contact angle and contact angle hysteresis) of 3D-printed microstructures are crucial factors influencing the operational effectiveness of 3D-printed microfluidic devices. Therefore, this study systematically examines the surface wetting characteristics of DLP-based 3D printing objects, focusing on various printing conditions such as lamination (or layer) thickness and direction. We preferentially examine the impact of lamination thickness on the surface roughness of 3D-printed structures through a quantitative assessment using a confocal laser scanning microscope.

However, conventional manufacturing processes (i.e., injection molding and CNC machining) are more economical than 3D printing for high-volume mass production. In addition, current 3D printing techniques are not capable of fabricating large components due to the limited build size of commercially available 3D printers. To increase 3D printing throughput and build volume, a novel cooperative 3D printing technique has been recently introduced. Cooperative 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process where individual mobile 3D printers collaborate on printing a part simultaneously, thereby increasing printing speed and build volume. While cooperative 3D printing has the potential to fabricate larger components more efficiently, the mechanical properties of the components fabricated by cooperative 3D printing have not been systematically characterized. This paper aims to develop a data-driven predictive model that predicts the tensile strength of the components fabricated by cooperative 3D printing.

The first sample was left in a UV oven and the second one in a dark cabinet, without access to sunlight (standard conditions 23/50 as described in ISO 554:1976). Non-contact structured blue light 3D metrology grade scanner was used to capture the entire part geometry for inspection. A comparison of subsequent scans after postcuring with reference scans after printing can indicate dimensional changes. The resulting scans are detailed enough to monitor shape and size changes over time. Findings: Universal 3D printing model beneficial in distortion analysis has been proposed. The method of evaluating 3D print distortions was verified using a metrology class 3D scanner. The results of this study show that deformations are declining through time to near the same values, the only difference is the rate of change of dimensions. Practical implications: Due to popularity and lower cost of polymer 3D printing, in comparison to metal 3D printing, an initial attempt to analyse the distortion of the locally melted substrate was done using MultiJet 3D printing with photopolymer material. The universal 3D print test part was proposed for verification of 3D printing deformations. Finally, the framework for the determination of 3D printing distortions is presented, taking into account the influence of UV postcuring. Originality/value: Analysis of a method to measure 3D printing distortions using a metrology grade 3D scanner is presented in the paper. Recently, this matter is becoming more and more important because many prototypes are increasingly produced by 3D printing and 3D printing distortions may cause many difficulties during the manufacturing and assembly process."
