As a result, necrotic areas within the tooth are formed that require removal and subsequent reconstruction in order to re-establish tooth function. This is achieved by replacing the demineralized areas with dental filling materials. With a wide variety of available dental filling materials, the dentist is faced with the task of choosing the correct material depending on the nature of the lesion. To date, the most widely used permanent filling materials are composites, which constitute one of the largest groups of filling materials.

Lightweight concrete is the most common material for low-rise construction. Existing lightweight concrete with the wood residues addition have several disadvantages due to the properties of the aggregate. In the southern regions of Russia, walnut grows in large quantities. Only a small part of the shell is processed, the rest is buried in the ground or burned. The proposed aggregate from crushed walnut shell has several advantages compared to the traditional natural organic fillers: low water demand and decay, high strength. The nutshell in the composition has sugars, which are the cement poisons, there are no data in the literature on the crushed shell technical characteristics. Thus, it is required to determine the crushed shell technical characteristics, to choose a processing method reducing the water-soluble sugars amount in the shell, to select the lightweight concrete composition, ensuring its optimal characteristics.

18,1,1,https://openalex.org/W2905154981,Composite Materials and Applications (39 vertices),"At present, the modern society utilizes composite materials in various branches of the national economy. The properties of such materials depend on their composition and structure, and may considerably differ from the properties of source materials. In turn, texture and structure of crystals, their packing order, size and level of sophistication affect the structure of materials. This is particularly demonstrated by hydration curing materials on the basis of gypsum and magnesia binding materials, as well as portland cement. Structuring control is one of the key problems of composite materials. Gypsum binding materials with various modification composition are suggested as a model system to study the influence of texture and structure of materials on their properties. One of them is the construction gypsum – an anhydrite binder and a multiphase gypsum binder (MGB). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was chosen as the main method of study. It is found that gypsum crystals that are formed during hydration and curing of gypsum binders with various modification composition have different texture and structure. It prevents from getting the optimal packing of a material. It is justified and confirmed that the MGB consisting of several modifications of calcium sulfate allow choosing the best material composition due to the combination of crystals having different size and form. Besides, MGB contains significant amounts of insoluble anhydrite that reduces the water-gypsum ratio of a binder and compacts its structure. Considerable attention is paid to microfillers, which significantly affect the texture and structure of materials based on gypsum binders. Iron ore concentrate of the Lebedinsky GOK generally consisting of magnetite, as well as impalpable flour cullet waste of sodium and potassium glass were used as microfillers in the given study. Ultra- and nanodispersed powders at their introduction to gypsum and anhydrite compositions change the size and morphology of crystal newgrowths and ensure the formation of ordered, denser and uniform fine-crystalline structures of composite materials, which leads to the reduction of structure imperfection, porosity and increase in contact areas of crystalline hydrates increasing physical and mechanical performance of gypsum materials. Efficient composite construction materials are obtained on the basis of MGB and microfillers."

It is noted that in the traditional approach the composite is considered as an unstructured medium, and in the case of a system approach, it is structured: in essence, a paradigm shift takes place in construction materials science. It is shown that the main feature of the system approach is the presence of the dominant role of the whole over the particular, complex over the simple; the more complex the system, the greater the effect of applying a systemic holistic approach. The properties of a composite material as a system object are given. It is assumed that there is a complete, integrative property of the system. The synthesis of composites takes into account the paradoxes of integrity (evaluation and analysis of composite materials should be based on the consideration of the material as an integral and unified system, on the other hand - the study of the material is impossible without analysing its parts) and hierarchy (description of the composite material as a system is possible only if its description as an element of the super system and vice versa). In accordance with the polystructural theory, a hierarchical structure of the radiation-protective composite is developed. It is shown that with strictly ordered criteria, the synthesis of the material reduces to a lexicographic optimization problem with the possibility of obtaining not only optimal strategies (the choice of prescription and technological parameters), but also the ordering of all strategies according to the degree of their preference. In the lexicographic optimization problem, an arbitrarily small increment of a more important criterion is assumed, due to any losses with respect to the remaining less important criteria. With conflicting criteria, the direct reduction of the optimization problem to lexicographic is not possible or not expedient. Here we use a not so rigorous ranking of criteria, as in the lexicographical case. One of the possible ways of synthesizing the material is given - the method of successive concessions. Realization of a method at synthesis of a composite of a special purpose is given. An approach is proposed for solving multicriteria problems on the basis of constructing Pareto sets (in informal analysis, those solutions that are obviously bad are excluded); is realized at multicriteria synthesis of epoxy composite of increased density for protection from radiation. High mobility of the obtained concrete mixes makes it possible to make piece products, building structures of any configuration and containers for transportation of radioactive materials. The dense structure of superheavy concrete allows it to be used for lining the enclosing structures of underground and ground bunkers, cemeteries and storage facilities for radioactive solid, liquid and gaseous wastes. Low porosity guarantees high values of brands for frost resistance, water and gas tightness."

The study of methods of concrete scrap utilization provided an opportunity to justify the appropriateness of its use as a component of building materials. The theoretical foundations for the production of composite facing materials using ground concrete scrap are based on the applied aspects of the methodology of creating new building (composite) materials, the main positions of which were formulated by the scientists of the Moscow State University of Civil Engineering.

26,0,1,https://openalex.org/W2108734212,Composite Materials and Applications (39 vertices),"Composite materials were synthesized by direct polymerization of propylene on the surface of natural or synthetic graphite particles. The method ensures grafting of polymer to a part of the filler particle surface, while the other part remains open to physical contact between the particles, the resulting properties of the material becoming favorably different from previously known composites. The coefficient of strain sensitivity K= Delta R/R epsilon (R is the resistance of the sample, epsilon is the tensile strain) was measured for different concentrations of filler at different temperatures. There is a broad maximum of K around the percolation threshold (4.5 vol.% for natural graphite) with a peak value of 100-150, which is much higher, compared to conventional wire resistors. A slight hysteresis is observed at unloading due to plasticity of the matrix. The hysteresis disappears when the temperature is lowered by 20-50 degrees, or epsilon is less than 1%, but the previous high value of K remains. Below the glass transition temperature K is very low. The results are explained by the rearrangement of current carrying chains in loading unloading cycles. The temperature dependence of resistance is presented, thermal conductivities were calculated for different models and compared with experimental values."

The necessity of studying the properties and structure of composite materials as a whole as systems connected by relationships that generate integrative qualities is pointed out. When synthesizing a composite, it is proposed to use the principle of simulability: a complex system is represented by a finite set of models reflecting a certain facet of its essence. This makes it possible to investigate a certain property or group of properties of a building material using one or several simplified (narrowly-oriented) models. Identification of new properties and entities is done on the basis of building up a set of simplified models (the reflection of a complex system as a whole is provided by the interaction of simplified models). Using the principle of purposefulness makes it possible to describe the quality of the material by some functionality for an integrated system. Internal causal relationships, the existence and function of the composite material (system) are based on the principle described physicality (any system regardless of the inherent physical laws of nature, possibly unique); no other laws are required to describe the operation of the system. The study of material properties is made on the basis of parametric identification of kinetic processes of formation of physical and mechanical characteristics of composite materials. For special purpose building materials, a number of particular criteria (properties) are determined, and their description is formalized using the principal component method (reducing the dimensionality of problems in assessing the quality of a material with simultaneous determination of a set of independent partial criteria). The results of the practical application of the method for evaluating the quality of composite materials with special properties are presented. Among the priority criteria were: strength, density and porosity of the material. Their dependences on the coded volume fractions of aggregate and filler were obtained by methods of mathematical experiment planning. It is shown that for most properties one can confine oneself to second-order differential models; each of the properties of the composite is considered as one of the particular criteria. Appendices are given to the development of composite materials for various purposes. Using the methods of control theory, an analytical description of the durability of the composite material is given; parametric identification is reduced to the determination of time constants in a second-order differential model, taking into account their dependencies on the prescription and technological parameters.

Since the sleepers are under complicated loading in real conditions, the first stage is static analysis of them. Future railway traffic will certainly be even faster than that of today, and at the same time the demanded load capacity of the trains will probably increase. This implies that the demands for concrete sleepers will increase and the need for reliable analytical tools will be extensive in the near future. The aim of this work is to increase the load capacity of the sleepers by means of composite materials and to make the railroad system ready for heavier and faster trains. The first step is applying a closed form solution. Then a finite element model of a concrete sleeper is established, in the nest step. Later a full-scale test of reinforced and non-reinforced sleepers is done, and at last, a validation of the finite element model through comparison with full-scale test results as well as closed form solution is conducted. The percentage of increased load capacity of sleepers and good agreements between the results make the work beneficial and reliable."

Elemental and granulometric analysis of nanopowder mixture fillers was carried out. The powders were shown to principally (a mixture of tungsten and titanium carbides) nanoparticles and nanoplates with sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm, larger particles are agglomerates. The attenuation of gamma radiation, in the energy range 0.662 to 2 MeV, is investigated as a function of the percentage nanoparticle concentration. The linear γ-radiation adsorption coefficients are determined. An optimum concentration of around 20% was established, with greater concentrations reducing the attenuation. By optimizing the concentration, a decrease of more than four times in the activity was observed when compared to the pure polyvinylacetate host."

In addition to activated BDCs, composites of BDCs to enhance electrode performance are also receiving the attention of researchers. In this chapter we limit our discussion to those BDC composites containing conductive materials, excluding conducting polymers as additives. The conductive substance helps to increase the conductivity, and good charge/discharge capability of BDCs electrode and composite formation increases the specific surface area and ability to store a large amount of charge. Incorporating conductive additives (i.e. metal, metal sulfide, carbon nanotubes (CNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) reduces the internal resistance of BDCs and provides a high specific capacitance value. Composites of BDCs material often integrate the charge storage mechanism of electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor, hence improving the energy density of the BDCs electrode. This chapter explains the composites of biomass-derived materials and conductive materials, excluding conducting polymers, for supercapacitors applications."

This study aims to use nano-layered materials as a host for Azo-compounds to form nano-hybrid materials and as filler for poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) to form nano-composite materials. A large anionic pigment (phenyl azobenzoic sodium salt; orange colour) has been intercalated into Zn-Al LDH and X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the interlayer spacing of Zn-Al LDH increased from 0.77 nm to 1.9-2.8 nm. Thermal analyses (TG and DTA) revealed the presence of a complex system of supra-molecular host-guest interactions. Nano-composite based on nano-hybrid Zn-Al-Azo LDH and PVA was prepared through intercalation reactions. It was characterised by X-ray diffraction, UV-Visible absorption spectra and thermal analyses. The results suggest that the nano-composites are formed via the re-aggregation of the delaminated LDH lamellar with the interlayer spacing 3 nm, and the thermal stability of the nano-composite improved compared with the original PVA."

Carbon-based nanomaterials, i.e., fullerenes, carbon black, single-walled, and multiwalled CNTs, GO, rGO, and graphene, were introduced as effective nanomaterials for different industrial applications. However, due to the unique electrical and thermal properties, graphene was known more than the others. Graphene and its derivates are some of the most common nanomaterials, which are extensively utilized in various applications, i.e., polymers due to the insufficient properties of pristine polymers. In other words, the presence of graphene-based nanofillers improves their durable properties. Evaluations confirmed that the existence of a low concentration of graphene (and its derivate) in the polymeric matrixes causes considerable effects on the natural properties of the graphene-containing polymeric matrixes. Recently, these nanoparticles have been applied in sensors, batteries, solar cells, etc. This chapter has focused on introducing graphene and the synthesis methods of its derivates, modification routes, and their impacts on the physical/chemical/thermal/anticorrosion properties of the polymeric matrixes."

But they have not been properly recycled, due to their inherent nature of heterogeneity, in particular for the thermoset-based polymer composites. The current and future waste management and environmental legislations require all engineering materials to be properly recovered and recycled, from end-of-life (EOL) products such as automobiles, wind turbines and aircrafts. Recycling will ultimately lead to resource and energy saving. Various technologies, mostly focusing on reinforcement fibres and yet to be commercialized, have been developed: mechanical recycling, thermal recycling, and chemical recycling. However, lack of adequate markets, high recycling cost, and lower quality of the recyclates are the major commercialization barriers. To promote composites recycling, extensive R&D efforts are still needed on development of ground-breaking better recyclable composites and much more efficient separation technologies. It is believed that through the joint efforts from design, manufacturing, and end-of-life management, new separation and recycling technologies for the composite materials recycling will be available and more easily recyclable composite materials will be developed in the future."

Increase in heat-resistant properties of the Portland cement knitting substance is offered to be solved by introduction to the structure of a cement composition of single substituted orthophosphate of calcium. The choice as an additive to the Portland cement a single substituted orthophosphate of calcium (double superphosphate) is proved by questions of safety measures and ecology, when using ortho-phosphoric acid and its salts for giving to cement compositions heat-resistant properties. The multicomponent composition of fine-grained concrete makes it possible to operate effectively the processes of forming the structure of cement stone at all stages of the technology, and to obtain materials with the most diverse set of properties. An introduction to the structure of a composite of 5% of filler of cyclonic dust of carbide of silicon, and a replacement of quartz filler by waste of abrasive production gave the increase of the compressive strength at 12%, bending strength for 36%.
