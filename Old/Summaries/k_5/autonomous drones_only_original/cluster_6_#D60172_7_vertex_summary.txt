Drone swarming involves multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are able to manoeuver autonomously, providing a vast range of surveillance applications such as traffic evaluations, driver monitoring, disaster management, temporary network support, and pedestrian tracking. All these applications are an integral part of urban surveillance. In this paper, we consider a variant of the combined truck-drone routing problem, which allows drones to serve multiple customers and provide both pickup and delivery services in each flight. We explicitly model the energy consumption of drones by their travel distance, curb weight and the carrying weight of parcels, develop a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) with problem-customized inequalities, and show a sufficient condition for the benefit of the combined truck-drone mode over the truck-only mode..
