In recent years, artificial intelligence has played an increasingly important role in the field of automated control of drones. After AlphaGo used Intensive Learning to defeat the World Go Championship, intensive learning gained widespread attention. However, most of the existing reinforcement learning is applied in games with only two or three moving directions.This study demonstrates that a drone flying above photovoltaic (PV) panels can clean the dust and enhance the panels’ efficiency. If operated regularly, the drone’s downward thrust generated during its cruise at a certain height above the panels can remove most of the accumulated dust.. This kind of Snake algorithm that can find the target path autonomously has broad prospects in the industrial field, such as: UAV oil and gas field inspection, Use drones to search for and rescue injured people after a complex disaster. As we all know, post-disaster relief requires careful staffing and material dispatch..
