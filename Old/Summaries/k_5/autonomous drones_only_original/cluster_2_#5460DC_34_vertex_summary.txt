In the recent decade, the rapid development of drone technologies has made many spatial problems easier to solve, including the problem of 3D reconstruction of large objects. A review of existing solutions has shown that most of the works lack the autonomy of drones because of nonscalable mapping techniques. This paper presents a method for centralized multi-drone 3D reconstruction, which allows performing a data capturing process autonomously and requires drones equipped only with an RGB camera. The method relies on a set of several user-defined parameters, which allows the tuning of the method for different task-specific requirements such as the number of drones, 3D model detalization, data capturing time, and energy consumption..
