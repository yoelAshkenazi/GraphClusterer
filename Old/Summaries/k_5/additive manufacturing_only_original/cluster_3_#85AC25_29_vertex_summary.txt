Ceramic samples were fabricated from alumina using traditional and additive technologies. Slipcasting technique was used to prepare sample as a traditional way, from pink alumina ceramic slurry with further drying a high temperature treatment of dried preformed ceramics. For preparation of second sample by additive route, stereolythography or SLA 3D-printing was used. Samples were studied using GE Vtomex c 450 X-ray tomography device. It is shown that additive technology due to high accuracy of fabrication is a perspective way of precision fabrication of ceramic parts with high quality.Cermets are a category of materials including ceramic and metallic phases, which possess the combined properties of both phases. And this applies not only to special properties, such as printability or shape stability, but also, it would seem, well-studied strength indicators. Most researchers in their works pay attention to the fact that the strength of samples obtained using molds does not correspond to the same indicator in printed structures. In this regard, this paper proposes a method for determining the strength of samples of standard sizes obtained by cutting out of a printed array. The analysis of the obtained results confirms the incorrectness of using standard methods for determining the strength indicators of additively manufactured materials when evaluating their design characteristics; the main direction for improving printing technology is the need to improve adhesion between layers; the expediency of increasing the width and thickness of tracks, which helps to reduce the number of contact zones. The proposed method is simple, accessible and does not require a special laboratory base.
