The scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) is an air-breathing engine with the supersonic flow at the combustor entrance, i.e., with essentially lower deceleration of flow in the inlet with respect to common ramjet. The scramjet is designed for hypersonic flight of vehicle with Mach number large than 5 or 6, where the efficiency of a subsonic ramjet decreases, because the deceleration of high-speed flow to small subsonic speeds leads to extremely high temperature at the entrance to combustor, that, in its turn, generates a series of effects, deteriorating the performance of classical ramjet..
