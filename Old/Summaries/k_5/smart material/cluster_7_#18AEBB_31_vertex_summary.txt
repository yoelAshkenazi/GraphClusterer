Abstract With the vigorous development of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, the active sensing system based on triboelectric nanogenerators plays an excellent performance potential and application value as a pioneering technology for smart manufacturing. Nevertheless, achieving material innovation to strike a good balance between active sensing systems and environmental friendliness remains a difficult task.Stimuli-responsive smart materials that can undergo reversible chemical/physical changes under external stimuli such as mechanical stress, heat, light, gas, electricity, and pH, are currently attracting increasing attention in the fields of sensors, actuators, optoelectronic devices, information storage, medical applications, and so forth. The current smart materials mostly concentrate on polymers, carbon materials, crystalline liquids, and hydrogels, which have no or low structural order (i.e., the responsive groups/moieties are disorderly in the structures), inevitably introducing deficiencies such as a relatively low response speeds, energy transformation inefficiencies, and unclear structure-property relationships..
