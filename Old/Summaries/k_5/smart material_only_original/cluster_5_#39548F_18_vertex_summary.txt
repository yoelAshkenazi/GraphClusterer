Stimuli-responsive smart materials that can be prepared by various methods have the ability to sense and respond to various kinds of physical and chemical stimuli in their environment. These materials have many potential applications in fibrous materials in the fields of medicine, protection, security communication, and textile electronics.Abstract Until now, enormous smart materials have been engineered with endogenous stimulators such as pH, reactive oxygen species, glutathione, hypoxia and enzyme, or exogenous stimulators such as temperature, light, ultrasound, radiation, and magnetic field in drug delivery. As footstone of stimuli‐responsive nanocarriers, endogenous/exogenous responsive smart materials possess many properties, such as responding to specific triggers, controlled drug release, long blood circulation, increased tumor accumulation, “ON‐OFF” switch activities, enhanced diagnostic accuracy, and therapeutic efficacy..
