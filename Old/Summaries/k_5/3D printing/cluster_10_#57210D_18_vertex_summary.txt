Abstract Object 3D printing technology has becoming more and more popular in medicine, we aim to describe the application experiences of 3D printing technology in endoscopic surgery for skull base tumors, with the assessment of 3D-printed models in skull base endoscopic surgery simulation and anatomy learning. Method Five patients with 3D-printed models were enrolled in our institution from October 2015 to March 2019. 5 individual models, created by different 3D printing methods and printing materials, were used to design the optimal surgical approach before surgery. Besides, the 3D-printed models were applied in endoscopic surgery simulation and anatomy learning. Likert scale questionnaires (1 indicating strongly disagree; 2, disagree; 3, neutral; 4, agree; and 5, strongly agree) were administered to 9 neurosurgeons in our institution to evaluate the application of 3D printed models..
