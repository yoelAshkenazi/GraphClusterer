A novel wind tunnel with conical and elevation structure is proposed and demonstrated for power generation.The use of ducted wind turbines is developing and various scientists in their studies investigate the performance, economic analysis, and energy production by these types of turbines at a lower cost. In this paper, the ratio of wind speed increment related to free stream wind speed and turbulence rate in a pre-designed duct used for a horizontal three-blade wind turbine was evaluated using a hot-wire anemometer sensor and data analysis methods.The duct installed in the University of Tehran Aerospace Faculty wind tunnel and flow characterization was performed by using CTA apparatus to measure and evaluate the wind flow turbulency in the throat section of the duct, where the wind turbine was installed..
