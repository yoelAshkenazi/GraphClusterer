Abstract The fast growth of 3D printing technology gives designers many ways to make structures that are hard to see. 3D printing lets you customize complex structures in any way you want and make rapid prototypes of materials. It enables you to simulate things more effectively. So far, experiments with polymer‐based lubrication have been done on atomically smooth surfaces, under dynamic conditions, and on the nano‐ or micro‐scale. The material requirements, skills, and representative applications of various 3D printing technologies are summarized. The efficient directions for future research in designing and making 3D‐printed lubrication structures are also pointed out.The application of machine learning and deep learning in additive manufacturing, also called 3D printing, is expected in industrial fields to be an effective method to optimize the manufacturing process, to control the quality of 3D printed objects, and to predict material properties. In the pharmaceutical field, 3D printed medicine has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and since then, 3D printing technology has been attracting attention, even creating a new model of tailored medicine..
