One of the most actual issues in the development of construction printing is the development of sound methods for determining the main properties of additively obtained composites. And this applies not only to special properties, such as printability or shape stability, but also, it would seem, well-studied strength indicators.This paper analyzes the current development of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies exploiting geopolymers (GPs) as promising green and sustainable 3D printable aluminosilicate inorganic materials. The analysis of the obtained results confirms the incorrectness of using standard methods for determining the strength indicators of additively manufactured materials when evaluating their design characteristics; the main direction for improving printing technology is the need to improve adhesion between layers; the expediency of increasing the width and thickness of tracks, which helps to reduce the number of contact zones..
