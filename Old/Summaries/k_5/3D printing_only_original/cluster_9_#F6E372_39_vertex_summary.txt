This is a review paper on 3D printing and the various materials used in 3D printing and their properties which become a notable topic in technological aspects.Since a three-dimensional (3D) printed drug was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, there has been a growing interest in 3D printing for drug manufacturing. There are multiple 3D printing methods - including selective laser sintering, binder deposition, stereolithography, inkjet printing, extrusion-based printing, and fused deposition modeling - which are compatible with printing drug products, in addition to both polymer filaments and hydrogels as materials for drug carriers..
