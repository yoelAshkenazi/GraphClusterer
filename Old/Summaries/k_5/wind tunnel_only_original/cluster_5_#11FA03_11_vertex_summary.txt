Traditionally, wind tunnel models are made of metal and the processes are very expensive. Since then, many researchers have been looking for new alternatives, hence 3D printing technology is the solution. Under right test conditions, 3D printed parts could be tested in a wind tunnel to get the aerodynamic performances. By using 3D printing technology, the cost and time can be significantly reduced to produce the wind tunnel models. This investigation was done to compare the aerodynamic performances which are drag and lift forces of the existing wind tunnel metal models with 3D printed wind tunnel models.. The wind tunnel testing covered the wind speed in the range of 0.57 m/s to 10.35 m/s at angle of-attack of 0Â°..
