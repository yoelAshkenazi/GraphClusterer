The main attention is paid to the depiction of the external security environment, and above all to the assessment of China and Russia as the countries of greatest concern from the point of view of security policy. Noting that the documents do not use the term &amp;quot;threat&amp;quot; in China&amp;apos;s assessment, the author concludes that Japan takes a more cautious position than the United States, trying not to be drawn into a confrontation between superpowers. As for Russia, the greatest alarmism is expressed not in relation to its policy as such, but in relation to its potential blocking with China on an anti—Japanese basis — the main &amp;quot;nightmare&amp;quot; for Tokyo. The article considers the issue of the &amp;quot;counter-offensive&amp;quot; missile potential provided for by the new strategy, which would allow Japan to strike at the enemy from a remote distance in the event of a direct threat to its security. The acquisition of such a potential has become particularly relevant for Japan in connection with the development of missile technologies of neighboring &amp;quot;hostile&amp;quot; countries — the DPRK and the PRC, as well as the general progress of missile weapons in the world, including the hypersonic ones.
