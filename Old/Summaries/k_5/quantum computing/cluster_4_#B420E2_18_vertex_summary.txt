Quantum computing is rapidly shifting from high-tech lab to mainstream commercial use in the next few years, representing the next breakthrough in modern ICT. It is motivated by quantum computer's ability to perform computational tasks with efficiencies that are not possible with classical computers.Today quantum computer modeling thematic attracts many scientists as it is difficult to examine theoretically synthesized quantum algorithms.The main problem is whether a newly created algorithm would have an efficient implementation on the quantum computer or not. Mathematical core of quantum computations is quite discovered and allows quantum computer workflow simulation using classical computers.However simulating the workflow without optimizations causes performance decrease even for modeling of small quantum systems consisted of less than ten qubits.One of the methods for molding performance improvement is using quantum gates transform optimization algorithm.The algorithm uses heuristic optimizations to achieve better performance result.In this work flowcharts of optimization algorithm presented describing single qubit quantum gate transform and controlled gate transform.The results comparison of the classical mathematical approach for quantum computer simulation and using optimization algorithm shows that there is a significant performance improvement using quantum gates transform optimization algorithm.This work is a study of the influence of the medium on the quantum system of qubits..
