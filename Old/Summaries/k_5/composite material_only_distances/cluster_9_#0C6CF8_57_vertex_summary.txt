This article is devoted to the study of the relationship between materials and ergodesign with various attributes.Examples of experimental research demonstrating the possibilities of using materials, along with other design and ergonomics tools, are given.The article describes the history of the development of Russian design and ergonomics as stages of the creation of the theory and methodology of ergodesign.The trends of formation and new developments in this area are considered.It is concluded that the creation of new objects of the subject world and systems cannot be carried out without integrated design activities with the introduction of the achievements of ergodesign, which is an innovative technology of integrated design.The article also responds to the problem, because of which the concept of ergodesign was adopted, namely the rapid development of technology without taking into account the needs and characteristics of a person.The urgency of the research is due to materials that are the basis of any material form, and from the point of view of innovative design, they must have unique properties, ensuring high-quality human activity at a new higher level.Let us consider textile composite materials which are most widely used in structures working under high temperatures.In composite materials, damage occurs even without excessive loading, because of the discrepancy between material parameters of adhered materials..
