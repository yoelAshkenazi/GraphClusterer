The necessity of coolant flow consumption measurement accuracy increase in the nuclear reactor primary circuit has been substantiated. Additionally, the need to control the coolant condition in the current flow inside the pipeline is shown.Nowadays, the real-time coolantâ€™s condition control function is not implemented at stationary nuclear power plants or mobile nuclear power plants used in moving objects.The stability analysis is given by means Lyapunov approach, thus the designed control system is guaranteed to be stable within a large range.Simulation results show that robust control and state estimation with adaptive robust feedback-linearization and adaptive Sliding mode methodologies can be achieved in nuclear plant systems with diverse applications including control and estimation in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances.One significant finding to emerge from this paper is that the Observer based Adaptive robust feedback-linearization control method provides a robust, high-performance and automatic control mechanism at all the power ranges of operation for P
