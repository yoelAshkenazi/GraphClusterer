Abstract The paper analyzes a possibility to involve hybrid thermonuclear reactors into the existing nuclear power systems. The possibility is related with production of non-traditional nuclear fuel in thorium blanket of hybrid thermonuclear reactors on D-T plasma. Non-traditional peculiarity of such a fuel consists in significant amounts of some non-traditional isotopes, namely 231 Pa and 232 U, together with traditional uranium isotope 233 U in the fuel.. The research methods are based on the adaptation of known technologies (including powder metallurgy) to the design of fast reactors and on the numerical simulation of physical processes carried out using computer programs for the analysis of emergency conditions of fast reactors (including anticipated transient without scram - ATWS)..
