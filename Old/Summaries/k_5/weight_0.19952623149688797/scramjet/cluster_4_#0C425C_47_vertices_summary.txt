Strut fuel injection approach significantly influences the combustion mechanism inside the scramjet engines. To address this issue, researchers are nowadays mainly focused on a scramjet model with two struts. As the performance of the two-strut model is improved as compared to the original single-strut model as per the latest research findings, therefore the current research is focused on the impact of the different shapes of the two-strut on the combustion flow-field study of scramjet engines..
