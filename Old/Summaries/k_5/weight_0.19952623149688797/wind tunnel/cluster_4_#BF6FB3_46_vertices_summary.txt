Abstract.Work has been carried out to determine the physical and mechanical properties of ABS plastics for the manufacture of aerodynamic models using the additive technology of layer-by-layer synthesis FDM for testing in wind tunnels. The samples were tested at normal and negative temperatures.With results of testing various models for several last years, the article will describe the capabilities of the IT-302M wind tunnel in terms of modeling of high-velocity flows in the Mach number range from 4 to 20 for external flow regimes and from 2 to 6 for the following flow parameters: total pressure from 5 to 1000 bar and total temperature from 700 to 3500 K; a series of tests was performed for comparisons of the results of inlet flows obtained in hotshot and blow down wind tunnels, including shock starting of the inlet and a possibility of its modeling by using a special device in the long-duration wind tunnel.The application of the gas curtain to the large section of tunnel in 2 # mining field and Longshou Mine of Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Corporation and Anqing Copper are described The wind door, the blower station, and the wind curtain in the tunnels with large section and pressure differentials, the choking rate is up to 85%～88%, and the blowing rate to the strope is 30～m 3/s, and the flowage in the tunnel is well adjusted It will be widely used in the underground mining.
