Abstract Operation of stands with canopies is possible under different landscape conditions, including conditions in areas with a slope or in areas with various obstacles that change the profile of the wind flow and, accordingly, affect the distribution of wind pressure acting on the surface of the canopy. Determination of the actual wind loads on the stands with a canopy is an important task due to the lack of appropriate schemes in the SP 20.13330.2016 “Loads and impacts”. The relevance of this problem is associated with the complexity of tests in specialized wind tunnels, as well as with the rapid development of computational fluid dynamics..
