The simulation was carried out in a wind tunnel, which makes it possible to study the aerodynamics of air currents in the goaf and evaluate the effectiveness of the use of the guiding device.This paper presents a method for safe testing of aircraft models equipped with a nonlinear dynamic vibration damper in a wind tunnel.Description both mobile and stationary multifunction set of optical research equipment created for investigations in wind tunnel are presented. Mobile equipment has field of vision up to 500 mm in diameter, stationary -- up to 1000 mm. Examples of interferograms, shadowgraphs and holograms, created in wind tunnel from subsonic to hypersonic velocities (0.1 less than M less than 16) are produced.The research on wind-driven rain (WDR) transport process of the splash-saltation has increased over the last twenty years as wind tunnel experimental studies provide new insights into the mechanisms of simultaneous wind and rain (WDR) transport..
