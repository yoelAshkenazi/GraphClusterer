In recent years, the potential applications of three-dimensional (3D) food printing have emphasized this technique's prospects. This chapter details a brief history of 3D printing and a description of 3D printing options for food. It focuses on hydrocolloids in the 3D printing process, with a mention of their use to control the texture of 3D-printed foods. Three techniques are well-suited for 3D printing: extrusion-based printing, the most prevalent technique in food printing; inkjet printing; and laser-assisted printing. Sugar is a malleable material that can take on many forms and colors; it is also compatible with 3D printing. The chapter concludes with some futuristic options, such as 3D printing and laser cooking and a novel application for four-dimensional food printing..
