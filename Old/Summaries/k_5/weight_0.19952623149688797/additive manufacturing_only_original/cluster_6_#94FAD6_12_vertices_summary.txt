Additive manufacturing (AM) has been widely used to fabricate functional metal parts in automobile, aerospace, energy, and medical device industries due to its flexible process capacity including complex geometry, functional graded materials, and free usage of tool. For the two major categories of metal additive manufacturing processes include powder bed fusion (PBF) and directed energy deposition (DED), parts are fabricated through melting of feed stock materials in the form of either powders or wires directly from a CAD model..
