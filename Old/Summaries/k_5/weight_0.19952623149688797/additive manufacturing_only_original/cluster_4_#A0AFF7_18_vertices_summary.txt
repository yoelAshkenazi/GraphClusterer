Additive technologies over the past two decades have formed a technological innovation segment of mechanical engineering: world markets for technologies, equipment have been formed, large-scale research and development work is being carried out, standards for product certification are being developed. The article discusses additive technologies and their definition. The main types of these technologies and their classification are understood.In recent years, the development of additive technologies has been a priority for industry. The technology makes it possible to realize any design and engineering ideas in high-tech industries, such as shipbuilding, aircraft construction, engine and motor construction, rocket engineering, modern electronic devices, and so on with minimum expenses. However, adaption of additive manufacturing of large-size products is associated with difficulties of transfer of laboratory research results in concrete items for various industries..
