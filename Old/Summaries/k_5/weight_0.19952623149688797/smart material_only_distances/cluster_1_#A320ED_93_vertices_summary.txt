Ferromagnetic shape memory alloys (FSMAs) are a recently-discovered member of smart materials. Smart materials undergo a substantial change in one or more properties in response to changes in external conditions such as applied loads, temperature, electrical and magnetic fields. Among these materials, Piezoelectrics, Magnetostrictives and conventional Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are more well-known. Piezoelectric materials are the most commonly used smart materials that can generate a potential difference when subjected to a mechanical stress/strain. Due to magnetoelastic coupling within the material, this may produce strains of up to 0.2%. Shape memory alloys are one of the most popular smart materials, with the ability to release residual strains and return to their initial configuration when heated up to a particular temperature [3].
