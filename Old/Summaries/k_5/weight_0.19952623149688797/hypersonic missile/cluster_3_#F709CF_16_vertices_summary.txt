One of the key points for the development of hypersonic airbreathmg propulsion is the mastery of fueled-cooled composite materials structures which are needed for realizing the combustor of a dual-mode ramjet operating up to Mach 8 or more. Very limited activities have been led by EADS France and SNECMA on this subject during the PREPHA program with basic test performed at ONERA. In the same time, EADS France developed a carbon/carbon hydrogen cooled injection strut, which has been successfully tested in CHAMOIS scramjet chamber. By comparison with the « classical » technology of assembled cooled panels, this technology will allow to limit the connecting problems, improve the mechanical characteristics and reduce the mass and the cost..
