Caries is the pathological process of hard tissue demineralization in teeth caused by various factors. As a result, necrotic areas within the tooth are formed that require removal and subsequent reconstruction in order to re-establish tooth function. This is achieved by replacing the demineralized areas with dental filling materials.

To date, the most widely used permanent filling materials are composites, which constitute one of the largest groups of filling materials..
