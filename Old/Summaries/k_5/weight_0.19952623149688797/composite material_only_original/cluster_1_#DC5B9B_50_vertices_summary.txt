Abstract The modern effective method of reinforced concrete bridge superstructures reinforcement using composite materials is considered. The results of comparative analysis of physical and mechanical properties of materials used to strengthen the bridge spans that have received defects and damage during their operation are presented. The results of the performed analysis of experimental studies of building structures reinforced by similar methods are shown..
