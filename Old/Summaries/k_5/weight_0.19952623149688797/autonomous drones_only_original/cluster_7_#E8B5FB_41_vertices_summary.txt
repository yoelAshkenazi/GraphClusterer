The main tool of the solution of this problem offers use of artificial neural networks of deep learning or convolution networks. The quantity of layers and dimensions of local networks at their use is proved in problems of autonomous navigation of drones on the basis of systems of technical sight.The paper considers problem of the attacking drone avoiding interception at the final stage of its flight.Duration of this stage is a few seconds.The literature traditionally considers the attack and the anti-aircraft drones independently.It is proposed to identify the attacking and the anti-aircraft drones as a single oscillatory system with the antagonistic components.Antagonistic components are connected using the non-Newtonian elastic element.Test game with a high-explosive drone, test game with a fragmentation drone and 2D salvo game were considered.The game in this case is not a traditional minimax optimization problem, but appears to be simulation of the compromise unstable motion mode.The output shows the result of the autonomous flight.We have developed the ultracompact (~300 g) fluorescence LIDAR and installed it on a quadrocopter for remote sensing of vegetation.The field tests have proved utilization of autonomous LIDAR monitoring for early crop disease detection.Problems of realization of completely autonomous systems of navigation are considered in a set of spheres of human activity today.The most important task is today the attempt to create on the basis of system of technical sight completely autonomous system of navigation for motor transport, the marine transport and aircraft.
