Advanced technological breakthroughs and exceptional levels of innovation are enhancing the capabilities and potential of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones), and in so doing attracting the interest of a broader swath of logistic companies, online retailers, and governmental agencies. These technology advancements and their impact on regulatory agencies may soon pave the way for the widespread use of drones for delivery and monitoring purposes.Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to drastically change the structure of future cities and regions. Researchers predict different outcomes to result from the emergence of CAV technology. While some see their potential as amounting to a complete overhaul of the transport system, others predict the technology will be slow to be adopted and may face competition from other mobility options such as drones..
