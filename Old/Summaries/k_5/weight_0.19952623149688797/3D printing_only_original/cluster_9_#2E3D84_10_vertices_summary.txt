Abstract: Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has gradually been applied to the field of orthoses. This narrative review aimed to investigate the effect of 3D printed orthoses compared to conventional orthoses (non-3D printed orthoses). We searched MEDLINE for articles published up to July 27, 2020, and the main search phrases for identifying related articles were “3D printed orthoses”, “3D printed braces”, “3D printed splints”, “3D printing orthoses”, “3D printing braces” and “3D printing splints”. A total of 237 papers were identified, and qualifications were evaluated based on the title, abstract, and full text..
