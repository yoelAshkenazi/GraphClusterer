In recent times, the utilization of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, particularly a variant using digital light processing (DLP), has gained increasing fascination in the realm of microfluidic research because it has proven advantageous and expedient for constructing microscale 3D structures. The surface wetting characteristics (e.g., contact angle and contact angle hysteresis) of 3D-printed microstructures are crucial factors influencing the operational effectiveness of 3D-printed microfluidic devices. Therefore, this study systematically examines the surface wetting characteristics of DLP-based 3D printing objects, focusing on various printing conditions such as lamination (or layer) thickness and direction..
