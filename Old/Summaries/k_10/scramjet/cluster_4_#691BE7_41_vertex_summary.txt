A comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of an approach based on the injection of a thin oxygen stream, subjected to a tailored electric discharge, into a supersonic H2–air flow to enhance the combustion performance in the mixing layer and in the scramjet combustor is conducted. It is shown that for such an approach there exist optimal values of reduced electric field E/N and transversal dimension d of the injected oxygen stream, which provide the minimal length of induction zone in the mixing layer. The injection of a thin oxygen stream (d = 1 mm) subjected to an electric discharge with E/N = 50–100 Td, which produces mostly singlet oxygen O2(a 1Δg) and molecules and atomic oxygen, allows one to arrange stable combustion in a scramjet duct at an extremely low air temperature Tair = 900 K and pressure Pair = 0.3 bar even at a small specific energy put into the oxygen Es = 0.2 J ncm−3, and to provide rather high combustion completeness η = 0.73. The main reason for the combustion enhancement of the H2–air mixture in the scramjet duct is the intensification of chain-branching reactions due to the injection of a small amount of cold non-equilibrium oxygen plasma comprising highly reactive species, O2(a 1Δg) and molecules and O atoms, into the H2–air supersonic flow..
