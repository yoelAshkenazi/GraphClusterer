The most urgent task in the construction industry today is energy saving at all stages: from the production of building materials, products and structures to the construction of buildings and their operation. Combining these problems forms one of the directions of innovation policy of the majority of subjects of the Russian Federation â€“ strengthening of local capacity and demonstration of solutions to improve energy and resource saving in construction. Building materials industry-one of the leading sectors of the economy, which is quite effectively uses secondary products of many industries for the production of various building materials.The paper studies the effect of combined field impact on cement compositions.The priority research direction involves creation of cement compositions and technologies that meet the requirements of technological availability and efficiency, environmental safety and sustainability, biocompatibility, economic efficacy and energy and resource saving.The paper proves that these criteria can be affected by material and field impacts on cement systems, which leads to considerable increase in strength of hardened cement paste, mortars and concretes.With this purpose, the paper presents detailed study on combined impact of ultrasound and magnetic field on grouting fluid of cement systems and strength of hardening systems in normal conditions.
