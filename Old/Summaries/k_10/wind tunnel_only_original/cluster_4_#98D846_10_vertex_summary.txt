Despite many studies describing wind speed and sediment flux profiles in various situations, wind tunnel observations in the presence of live vegetation are infrequent and rarely combined with field measurements. To investigate the structure of wind speed and sediment flux profiles in morphologically different vegetation and various plant densities, wind velocity and sediment flux profiles were obtained over a multi-row windbreak in an arid environment and over unplanted surfaces and canopies of two types of plants in a wind tunnel. Although the two plant types in the wind tunnel have different morphology, the profiles of wind velocity and sediment flux showed structures similar to those for other plant types reported in previous studies which indicates that profile structures are likely common for homogeneous canopies even with different plant morphology and in various wind velocities..
