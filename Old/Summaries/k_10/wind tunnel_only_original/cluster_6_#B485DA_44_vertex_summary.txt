A natural barrier, such as a hill or a small mountain, might be the location of a great potential for wind energy production. The expression ‘wind dam’ refers to a newly proposed concept which aims to take advantage from the existing geographical natural barriers, in order to generate a high speed wind zone for installation of wind turbines. Previous studies have claimed that excavating a tunnel in a hill, connecting its high pressure zone to the low pressure zone, provides not only a suitable location for wind turbines, but also minimizes the negative environmental and visual impacts of the installed wind turbines. In the current study, a numerical modelling approach was implemented for a through calculation of the flow and heat transfer in all areas of the wind tunnel circuit (heater, pre-chamber, nozzle, test section, diffuser). The work delivers the results of air flow numerical study in wind tunnel duct parts in presence of air exchange holes.The application of the gas curtain to the large section tunnel in 2 # mining field and Longshou Mine of Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Corporation and Anqing Copper Mine are described The wind door, the blower station, and the wind window are substituted by the multiple gas curtain in the tunnels with large section and pressure differentials, the choking rate is up to 85%～88%, and the blowing rate to the strope is 30～40m 3/s, and the flowage in the tunnel is well adjusted It will be widely used in the underground mining.At present, there is a great interest in the development of new airfoils for wind turbines and high-lift wings of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).
