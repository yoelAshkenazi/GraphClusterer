The basic tasks of the simulation proposed in the work are determined within the framework of the algorithm for executing quantum algorithms, taking into account entanglement. A technique has been developed for modeling entangled quantum calculations applicable in the Simon quantum algorithm, which helps to predict the behavior of the quantum algorithm (or any other computing process that proceeds as part of the work of a quantum computer system) with partial entanglement..
