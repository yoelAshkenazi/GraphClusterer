Recently, extrusion-based 3D printing has been widely used to manufacture precise and accurate 3D structures with high nanocellulose concentrations due to excellent materials flow control and system stability. With the extrusion-based 3D printing technique, the main challenges for precision and accuracy in high concentration nanocellulose 3D printed structures are proper printing parameters and appropriate adhesion between printed layers. Therefore, this study aims to improve the adhesion between high content nanocellulose printed layers by blending different lignin concentrations and optimizing the twin-screw extruder printing parameters..
