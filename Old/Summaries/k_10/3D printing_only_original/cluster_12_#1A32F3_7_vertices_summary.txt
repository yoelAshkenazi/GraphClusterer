Abstract In tissue engineering, 3D printing is an important tool that uses biocompatible materials, cells, and supporting components to fabricate complex 3D printed constructs. This review focuses on the cytocompatibility characteristics of 3D printed constructs, made from different synthetic and natural materials. From the overview of this article, inkjet and extrusion-based 3D printing are widely used methods for fabricating 3D printed scaffolds for tissue engineering. This review highlights that scaffold prepared by both inkjet and extrusion-based 3D printing techniques showed significant impact on cell adherence, proliferation, and differentiation as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies..
