The popularity of the Open Source Tool (OST) has expanded significantly. This is the case for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based on open-source hardware (OSH) as well.Nowadays one of the critical tasks for analyzing the usage of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as base stations is the development of effective UAV control strategies while servicing customers one the ground. The main problem is states within ultimate battery capacity, which limits the UAV's flight's duration and battery lifetime. This paper presents a scenario for placing UAVs on stationary objects, such as roofs, walls or balconies of buildings, in the process of providing communication services. Such a strategy provides drones to extend their autonomous work during the flight in the customer service area, as the main source of power consumption, the engine, can be turned off for long periods of time after arriving in a subscriber's service area. The paper compares the proposed scenario with the standard flight mode of UAVs.Thrusters are a vital part of any autonomous under-water or surface vehicle. However, due to their high costs, they are often out of reach of researchers and students in developing countries. While many designs are available using off-the-shelf drone motors, they are either not open source or do not provide performance details.
