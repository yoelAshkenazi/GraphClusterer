Potential field approaches have been often used to describe and model interactions within a swarm of robots performing collective motion, also called flocking. Despite the high number of proposed approaches, most have only been tested in simulation and among the minority tested on real robots, even fewer abandoned the laboratory boundaries in favor of real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a decentralized flocking approach that builds over the classical potential field models and that is proved to work well both in simulated and real-world environments.Effective robot navigation is crucial for the proper implementation of a mobile robot. To navigate a robot in an indoor or outdoor environment, a map of the surrounding obstacles is required. This paper presents a robotic operating system based on autonomous simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and robot navigation implementation of a Parrot AR.0 quadrotor, which is equipped with a laser scanner and inertial measurement unit..
