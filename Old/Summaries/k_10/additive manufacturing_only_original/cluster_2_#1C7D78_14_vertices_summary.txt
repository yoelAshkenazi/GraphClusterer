Improved solutions for monolithic construction formwork systems are designed to decrease specific weight of formworks, improve the quality of concrete surface and accommodate complex walls. Having analyzed the conventional designs of formwork systems, that consist of prefabricated panels with waterproof plywood bottom attached to metal frame, the authors came to the conclusion that formwork systems need a cardinally new solution in order to achieve the above specifications. A series of experiments were performed on samples of additively manufactured synthetic fiber-reinforced plastic composites. The use of additive technologies opens up the prospect of creating formwork elements for complex walls, while the use of plastic can decrease specific weight of formworks and improve the quality of the front surface of monolithic concrete structures..
