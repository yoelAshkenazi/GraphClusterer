Donald J. Trump administration have not made final decisions regarding missile defense policy yet. Plans continue to change.The article delivers an analysis of how missile defense budget requests on FY 2020 and FY 2021 correlate with 2019 Missile Defense Review priorities. The first section of the article is about U.S. homeland defense policy.The research shows that the real aerial weapon, i.e. hypersonic missile warhead and the target simulator of the MALD type, in bistatic radar result in significantly different topological scattering patterns when taking into account the radiation polarization. Radiation with p -polarization allows for a more expressive topological scattering pattern than in the case of s -polarization, and the Î¸ angle change of the place gives a brighter relief pattern with alternating maxima and deep minima, which leads to an assumption about a high resolving power when identifying the objects by means of the gradient method..
