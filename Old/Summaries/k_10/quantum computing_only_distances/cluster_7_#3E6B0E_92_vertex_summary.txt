Using atoms as digital bits will start a completely new era in computer design. The behavior of matter on the atomic scale follows the rules of modern physics. This behavior cannot be understood in terms of our classical description of the world (i.e. Newtonian mechanics or Maxwell's equations in electromagnetics). The author describes how such a quantum computer-a computer based on the rules of quantum mechanics-may work, and how it is going to give incredible speed and problem-solving power..
