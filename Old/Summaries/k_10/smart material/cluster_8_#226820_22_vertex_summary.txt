Abstract Stimuli‐responsive or smart materials have recently shown a significant impact on the frontier of material science and engineering. The exponential development of synthetic host molecules (SHMs) over the last decades and their corresponding host–guest chemistry, have empowered researchers with new opportunities to design and construct tailored or guest‐specific smart materials. In this Minireview, we present the recent advancements in synthetic host based smart materials, ranging from the fabrication strategies to the state‐of‐art applications including adsorption, separation, luminescence, self-healing and actuation. The role that the host–guest chemistry plays in these systems is highlighted throughout to give a better prospective of the available possibilities for emerging materials of future economies.. Among them, Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been known as an unrivaled material in the touchscreen manufacturing industry for many years, due to its great properties like high transparency and low electrical resistance. However, the low strain strength of ITO and high price of Indium became its bottleneck for recent progressive electronic-based applications requiring high flexibility (e.g., in wearable smart devices) and low cost. Although graphene has still a long way to go to meet the properties needed to make it suitable for smart touchscreen applications, it has a large potential to be used in such technologies. In this review, the role of CVD-grown graphene in developing smart touchscreen devices and their world market has been reviewed.
