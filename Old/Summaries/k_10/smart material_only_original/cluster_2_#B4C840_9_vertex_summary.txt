Energy transition, and the related chemistry transition due to their strong nexus, is creating a major worldwide change in the current production system, driven initially by social and environmental pressures (cleaner production, reduced greenhouse gas emissions), but today instead is pushed by economic (renewable energy sources are becoming progressively the more economic energy form) and geopolitical (energy security) motivations. Oil and natural gases are the building blocks of the current refinery and (petro)chemistry, but going beyond fossil fuels is the challenge associated with this transition. This has also major implications on the technologies and processes actually in use, further pushed from another emerging direction associated with the progressive change from centralized to delocalized productions, for a better link with the territory and the local resources.1 Catalysis, particularly based on the use of solid catalytic materials, was one of the key enabling technologies of the current refinery and petrochemistry, with other 90% of the processes using heterogeneous catalysts and an economic impact (direct and indirect) of about one-third of the gross domestic product..
