Physical-chemical principles of the operation of smart materials were considered. It was established that the work of the smart materials is founded on the principles of the operation of cooperative systems â€” the systems of the limiting dimensions. Nonadditivity (cooperativity) of the operation of the systems is conditioned by the effect of the change of the system as a whole in the processes that proceed. The properties of the biological and cooperative systems are qualitatively equal, except for the properties of the biological systems connected with the transfer of the information..
