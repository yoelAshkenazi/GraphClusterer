Abstract Radioactive waste management is one of the main tasks of the nuclear power industry. Spent nuclear fuel poses a threat to the environment if it leaks from the storage facility. A possible solution to reduce waste storage and reduce the economic pressure of natural uranium shortages is to use minor actinides as fuel for nuclear reactors. This article is dedicated to the possibility of burning Cm in a reactor with curium fuel, as a result of which It can be used as fuel for a nuclear reactor. The purpose of the research is to study the possibility of creating a model of a reactor with curium fuel.At the new centure's begin eight countries with developed nuclear power industry took part under the aegis of the IAEA in research of innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles to choose a nuclear power system with fast reactors based on a closed fuel cycle (CFC) and to perform joint R&D in this direction..
