The theory of technological uncertainty attributes the destabilizing effect of weapons to the divergence of states' perceptions of the balance of powers, to the hyped expectations regarding the ability to compensate quantitative limitations with qualitative superiority, to the alarmistic sense of closing windows of opportunities and growing vulnerabilities.The article tests the theory against the historical record of military clashes in Europe from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries, as well as the crises between superpowers during the Cold War.The empirical cases are selected in order to cover the period marked by the intensification of qualitative arms races between states.In addition, it is also the period most often used to substantiate the offense-defense balance theory.The history of the last two and a half centuries provides a solid foundation for the theory of technological uncertainty.A somewhat optimistic caveat to its conclusions is the fact that currently emerging weapons are at various stages of development.The greatest likelihood of military clashes corresponds to the overlap of several technological uncertainties.The paper focuses on the problem of calculating the approximate ballistic missile trajectory, the calculation ensuring that the missile travels from a given launch point to the finish point and covering the entire range rate for the missiles of the type considered.The results of numerical calculations in a wide range of freestream Mach numbers are compared with the experimental data and computational results of other researchers.The article is devoted to the numerical modelling of the force and thermal effects acting on a submarineâ€™s missile silo during an underwater missile launch..
