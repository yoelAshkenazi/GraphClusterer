&lt;p&gt;One of the most important problems in anti-missile systems is localisation ambulatory missiles’ defence sites along with fixed missiles’ defence sites in best positions to destroy enemy’s missiles.. The main purpose of the work is to establish the relationship between atmospheric parameters and ballistic characteristics of missile engagement in general and air-to-air missiles in particular.The article considers methods of solving the target allocation problem in surface-to-air missile systems for missile defence. Important specifics of the problem in question are rapid nature of anti-missile combat and the requirement for target illumination during homing. The control methods suggested make it possible to increase the efficiency of solving the target allocation problem by means of using prior data on target engagement probability and radar load estimation in the neighbourhood of future position points at the fire planning stage..
