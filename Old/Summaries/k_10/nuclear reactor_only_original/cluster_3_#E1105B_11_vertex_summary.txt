A brief exposition of the principles of the use of nuclear reactions for energy generation is given.Current ways of using nuclear energy are described starting with main sources of utilising nuclear energy. The nuclear fuel cycle is introduced followed by brief characterisation of most used power reactors such as boiling water reactor, pressurised water reactor and water-water energetic reactor.This article presents an innovative nuclear power technology, based on the use of modular type fast-neutron reactors SVBR-75/100 having heavy liquid-metal coolant, i.e. eutectic lead–bismuth alloy, which was mastered in Russia for the nuclear submarines’ reactors.Experience of using lead-bismuth coolant in reactors of Russian nuclear submarines is briefly presented.The salient points of the concept providing the safety of reactor facilities cooled by a lead-bismuth eutectic are covered.The key results of developments for use of a lead-bismuth coolant in nuclear reactors and accelerator-driven system, are presented.The basic requirements for the energy sources of the future are satisfied by energy systems based on transmutation of atomic nuclei.Among them, the reactors of fission of heavy nuclei have been technologically mastered.For operating reactors, severe accidents with unacceptable releases of radioactive substances beyond the boundaries of nuclear power plants (NPP) cannot be ruled out.Achieving the ideals of internal safety is possible for fast reactors of small and medium power with the use of lead coolant and mononitride fuel (BREST concept).In this regard, the development (including based on the BREST ideas) of new safe reactors for various purposes is relevant.With limited time for commissioning new energy systems, the use of existing technologies is relevant.In the last decade, new nuclear technologies have been actively developed that allow them to be used in the design of new generation reactors.
